## Alex's Collection

### Moog Subsequent 37

**Type**: Analog monophonic/duophonic
**Purchased**: 2021
**Use Case**: Bass, leads, drones

Key features:
- 37 keys with aftertouch
- 2 oscillators + sub oscillator
- Ladder filter (classic Moog sound)
- Extensive modulation options

Alex's perspective:
> "The Moog is my desert island synth. That filter is pure butter. I've spent entire weekends just making bass patches."

### Elektron Digitakt

**Type**: Digital sample-based drum machine/sequencer
**Purchased**: 2020
**Use Case**: Drums, sampling, sequencing

Features utilized:
- 8 track sequencer
- Sample manipulation
- Parameter locks
- Overbridge integration with Ableton

Usage notes:
- Often sequences other hardware
- Source for glitchy textures
- Live performance backbone

### Roland JP-8000

**Type**: Virtual analog polysynth
**Purchased**: 2022 (used)
**Use Case**: Pads, super saw leads, vintage sounds

Notable aspects:
- Classic trance/techno sounds
- Super saw waveform
- Hands-on control
- "Nostalgic purchase" per Alex

## Synthesis Methods

### Understanding Different Types

Knowledge gained from conversations:

1. **Subtractive Synthesis**: Start rich, filter down
   - Most common (Moog)
   - Intuitive for beginners
   
2. **FM Synthesis**: Frequency modulation
   - Complex timbres
   - Steep learning curve
   
3. **Wavetable**: Scanning through waveforms
   - Modern, evolving sounds
   - CPU efficient

4. **Granular**: Microscopic sample manipulation
   - Experimental textures
   - Alex loves for ambient

## Integration with DAW

### Workflow with [[concepts/ableton_live]]

Connection setup:
- Audio interface: Universal Audio Apollo Twin
- MIDI routing through USB
- Analog inputs for Moog
- Overbridge for Digitakt

Recording approach:
- Multiple takes for variations
- Resample through effects
- Layer hardware with software

## Gear Philosophy

### Alex's Approach

> "I definitely have gear acquisition syndrome, but each piece serves a purpose. The Moog for analog warmth, Digitakt for rhythm and sampling, JP-8000 for those nostalgic digital pads."

**Purchase criteria**:
1. Must fill a sonic gap
2. Hands-on control important
3. Build quality matters
4. Resale value consideration

### GAS (Gear Acquisition Syndrome)

Self-aware about it:
- Watches Reverb.com "too much"
- Has spreadsheet of dream gear
- Partner Sam enforces "one in, one out" rule
- Saving for modular system

## Maintenance & Care

### Best Practices Learned

- Regular cleaning (dust is enemy)
- Stable power (surge protectors)
- Temperature control important
- Backup patches regularly

### Troubleshooting

Common issues Alex mentioned:
- MIDI timing with hardware
- Ground loop hums
- Analog drift (feature not bug)
- Integration complexity

## Future Aspirations

### Modular Dreams

Alex's modular plans:
- Start with Moog Mother-32
- Add Make Noise modules
- Focus on generative patches
- Budget: $3000-5000

### Vintage Interests

Watching for deals on:
- Juno-106 (classic poly)
- Yamaha DX7 (FM classic)
- Oberheim Matrix (unique sound)

## Cultural Context

### Synthesis Community

- Seattle synth meetups
- Patchwerks workshops
- Online forums (GearSlutz, Reddit)
- YouTube synthesis channels

### Historical Appreciation

Alex's knowledge includes:
- Moog's legacy
- Detroit techno connections
- Berlin school influence
- Modern renaissance of analog
