## Context

Saturday morning conversation. Alex preparing for summer hiking season, wanted advice on trails and planning for potentially doing the John Muir Trail.

## Opening

> "Good morning! The sun is actually out in Seattle (miracle!) and I'm planning my summer hiking calendar. Thinking big this year - maybe JMT? But also want to explore more of the North Cascades. Thoughts?"

## Key Topics Covered

### 1. Current Hiking Experience Assessment

**Alex's Background**:
- 10+ years hiking Pacific Northwest
- Completed Wonderland Trail (2022) [[concepts/mount_rainier]]
- Enchantments permit holder (3 times)
- Comfortable with 20+ mile days
- Has ultralight setup (base weight ~10 lbs)

> "I'm definitely not a beginner, but the Sierra Nevada feels like a different beast than the Cascades. Plus, permits are intimidating."

### 2. John Muir Trail Discussion

**Key Planning Points Covered**:
- Permit strategy (lottery opens in January)
- Resupply logistics (5-6 stops needed)
- Elevation adjustment coming from sea level
- Late July/August optimal for snow conditions
- Budget: ~$2000-3000 including permits, food, transport

**My Recommendations**:
- Start with shorter Sierra trips for acclimatization
- Consider SOBO (southbound) for better permit odds
- Use bear canisters (required), not Ursacks
- Plan for 16-18 days (Alex's pace)

### 3. Local Alternatives Discussed

**North Cascades Options**:
- Copper Ridge Loop (new to Alex)
- Ptarmigan Traverse (technical but stunning)
- Section J of PCT through Glacier Peak
- Sahale Arm (day hike but spectacular)

Alex particularly interested in Ptarmigan Traverse:
> "I've heard it's like the Enchantments on steroids. My kind of Type 2 fun!"

### 4. Gear Discussion

**Current Setup**:
- Zpacks Duplex tent
- Enlightened Equipment quilt
- Hyperlite Mountain Gear pack
- "More gear than sense sometimes" (Alex's words)

**Considering Upgrades**:
- InReach Mini for Sierra Nevada
- New water filter (current one slow)
- Bear canister (BearVault BV500)

## Personal Moments

### Work-Life Balance Theme

> "You know, I've been debugging production issues for three weeks straight. I need these mountains. My therapist says it's 'grounding' but I think it's more like 'defragging my mental hard drive.'"

### Music-Hiking Connection

Revealed that many field recordings come from hikes:
> "Half my ambient tracks start with a recording from some alpine lake. Last year I got 10 minutes of wind through the larches at Colchuck Lake. Turned into my best track yet."

### Relationship Status Mention

First time mentioning partner:
> "My partner Sam isn't into long hikes, but they're supportive. They call it my 'quarterly reboot.' They prefer car camping, which we do together."

## Advice Synthesis Provided

1. **For JMT**: Start permit application early, do practice Sierra hikes
2. **For Local**: Ptarmigan Traverse as stepping stone to bigger objectives
3. **For Balance**: Schedule hikes like "mental health deployments"
4. **For Creativity**: Bring lightweight recording setup on JMT

## Memorable Insights

**On solo hiking**:
> "I actually prefer solo trips. It's like meditation but with more blisters and better views. Plus, I can stop whenever I want to record sounds."

**On technology disconnect**:
> "The best part? No Slack notifications at 14,000 feet. Though I did have a nightmare once about getting a pull request review on top of Mount Whitney."

## Action Items

Alex committed to:
1. Apply for JMT permits in January lottery
2. Book Ptarmigan Traverse for late June
3. Test new gear on local trips
4. Share trail recordings for next music project
