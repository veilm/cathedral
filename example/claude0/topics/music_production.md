## Core Knowledge

### Software & Tools

#### Ableton Live [[concepts/ableton_live]]
- Version: 11 Suite
- Primary DAW for Alex's production
- Key features utilized:
  - Max for Live devices
  - Spectral Resonator
  - Granular synthesis tools
  - Complex warping algorithms

#### Hardware Synthesizers [[concepts/synthesizers]]
- **Moog Subsequent 37**: Analog, used for bass and lead sounds
- **Elektron Digitakt**: Sample-based drum machine/sequencer
- **Roland JP-8000**: Virtual analog, "super saw" capabilities
- **Effects pedals**: Strymon BigSky, Eventide Space

### Production Techniques

#### Ambient Music Specific
1. **Layering Philosophy**: "Less is more" - limit to 8-12 core elements
2. **Spatial Design**: Create depth with reverb sends, not insert effects
3. **Frequency Management**: 
   - High-pass filter almost everything except bass
   - Leave space 100-250Hz for warmth
   - Cut before boost

#### Workflow Optimizations
- Template-based approach with bus groups
- A/B testing with reference tracks
- Mix at low volumes (protect ears, better balance)
- Regular breaks (30-minute rule)

### Creative Process

#### Field Recording Integration
- Alex records nature sounds during hikes [[topics/hiking_pacific_northwest]]
- Processing techniques:
  - Granular synthesis for texture
  - Pitch shifting for atmospheric drones
  - Convolution reverb using outdoor impulses

#### Arrangement Philosophy
> "Think of it like refactoring code - start with core functionality, then optimize" - [[episodes/2024-01-22_music_production]]

### Artist Influences

**Primary Inspirations**:
- Tim Hecker: Noise and beauty balance
- William Basinski: Tape loop degradation
- Boards of Canada: Nostalgic textures
- Biosphere: Minimal arctic soundscapes

**Local Scene**:
- Seattle ambient community
- Monthly meetups at Georgetown studio
- Collaborative live performances

## Challenges & Solutions

### Common Issues

1. **Over-layering**: 40+ tracks creating "mud"
   - Solution: Subtractive arrangement
   - Group processing for cohesion

2. **Decision Paralysis**: Too many plugin options
   - Solution: Limited palette per project
   - Commit to decisions early

3. **Mixing in Isolation**: Losing perspective
   - Solution: Reference tracks
   - Car test, phone speaker test

### Technical Challenges

- CPU optimization for large projects
- Latency management with hardware
- Phase issues with multiple reverbs

## Personal Context

### Alex's Musical Journey
- Started 5 years ago as "stress relief from coding"
- Self-taught through YouTube and experimentation
- Released 8 EPs as "Cascade Synthesis"
- ~50 monthly Bandcamp listeners

### Goals & Aspirations
- Score video game or indie film
- Perform live at Kremwerk or Nectar Lounge
- Collaborate with visual artists
- Build modular synthesis rig

## Production Philosophy

Key principles Alex has developed:
1. **Embrace Imperfection**: "Bugs can be features"
2. **Systematic Creativity**: Use programming mindset for workflow
3. **Environmental Inspiration**: Pacific Northwest as sonic palette
4. **Technical as Creative**: Limitations spark innovation
