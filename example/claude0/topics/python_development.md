# Python Development

## Topic Overview

Backend development knowledge using Python, representing [[people/alex_chen]]'s full-stack capabilities beyond frontend specialization.

## Tags
`backend` `python` `programming` `api-development` `full-stack`

## Technical Stack

### Frameworks Used

#### FastAPI
- Modern async framework
- Type hints integration
- Automatic API documentation
- Current preference for new projects

Alex's take:
> "FastAPI is what happens when Python developers finally embrace types. It's like TypeScript for backend."

#### Django
- Used in previous roles
- Good for rapid development
- "Batteries included" philosophy
- ORM sometimes limiting

### Libraries & Tools

**Core Dependencies**:
- SQLAlchemy (ORM when not using Django)
- Pydantic (data validation)
- Celery (task queues)
- Redis (caching, sessions)
- pytest (testing framework)

**Development Tools**:
- Poetry for dependency management
- Black for formatting
- mypy for type checking
- Ruff for linting

## Use Cases

### Current Work Applications

At TechCorp:
- Microservices for order processing
- API Gateway implementations
- Background job processing
- Data pipeline components

### Integration Patterns

With frontend React apps:
- RESTful APIs primarily
- Some GraphQL experimentation
- WebSocket connections
- JWT authentication

## Code Style & Philosophy

### Type Hints

Strong advocate after TypeScript:
```python
def process_order(
    order_id: str,
    items: List[OrderItem],
    user: User
) -> ProcessResult:
    # Type safety brings sanity
```

### Async Patterns

Embraces modern async:
```python
async def fetch_data(
    session: AsyncSession,
    filters: QueryFilters
) -> List[Result]:
    # Concurrent operations
```

## DevOps Integration

### Containerization
- Docker for all Python services
- Multi-stage builds for size
- Alpine vs. Debian debates
- docker-compose for local dev

### CI/CD
- GitHub Actions workflows
- Automated testing pyramids
- Coverage requirements (>80%)
- Deployment to K8s

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Techniques

Learned through experience:
1. Profile before optimizing
2. Caching strategically
3. Database query optimization
4. Async where beneficial

### Common Bottlenecks

Encountered and solved:
- N+1 query problems
- Synchronous I/O blocking
- Memory leaks in long-running processes
- GIL limitations for CPU-bound tasks

## Testing Philosophy

### Approach

Similar to frontend:
> "If it's not tested, it's broken"

**Test Pyramid**:
- Many unit tests (pytest)
- Integration tests for APIs
- Few E2E tests
- Property-based testing experiments

### Mocking Strategy
- Minimal mocking
- Prefer real databases in tests
- TestContainers for integration
- Factory patterns for test data

## Learning Journey

### Evolution

1. Started with Django (bootcamp)
2. Moved to Flask (flexibility)
3. Adopted FastAPI (modern approach)
4. Exploring Rust for performance

### Current Interests

Python ecosystem:
- Pydantic v2 adoption
- UV package manager
- Ruff replacing multiple tools
- Type system improvements

## Cross-Language Insights

### Python vs. JavaScript

Alex's comparison:
- "Python's batteries included vs. JS's choose-your-adventure"
- "Type hints voluntary but valuable"
- "Async similar concepts, different syntax"
- "Package management still better in Python"

### Applying Frontend Patterns

Concepts transferred:
- Component thinking to service design
- State management to database design
- React's composition to Python decorators
- Testing strategies similar

## Real Project Examples

### Order Processing Service

Built at current job:
- FastAPI service
- PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy
- Redis for caching
- Celery for async processing
- 10k requests/minute

### Personal Projects

Music-related tools:
- MIDI processing scripts
- Ableton Live API integration
- Audio file organization
- Bandcamp stats scraper

## Pain Points & Solutions

### Common Frustrations

1. **Dependency Hell**: Solved with Poetry
2. **Slow Tests**: Parallel execution, better fixtures
3. **Type Checking**: Gradual adoption, pragmatic approach
4. **Debugging Async**: Better logging, tracing

## Community Involvement

### Resources Used

- Real Python articles
- Talk Python podcast
- PyCon videos
- Local Python meetups

### Open Source

Contributions mentioned:
- Small PRs to FastAPI
- Internal tools open-sourced
- Documentation improvements
- Example repositories

## Future Directions

### Interests

Where Alex sees Python going:
- Better performance (3.12+)
- More type safety
- WebAssembly targets
- AI/ML integration (considering)

### Personal Goals

- Master async patterns fully
- Contribute more to open source
- Build music analysis tools
- Explore Python for data engineering
