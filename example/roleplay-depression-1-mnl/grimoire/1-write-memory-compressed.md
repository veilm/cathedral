## Task
Update the index.md content above by adding new episodic and semantic memories from this conversation.

## Episodic Memory Guidelines
Write a concise narrative capturing the essential arc of what happened:
- Use first person ("I responded", "The human asked me")
- Focus on key turning points, decisions, and relationship changes
- Link to source files using format: [[20250710/A/0-world.md]]
- Target approximately 25% of original conversation length
- Prioritize: What happened? What changed? What was decided?

## Semantic Memory Guidelines
Extract essential facts and frameworks:
- Organize into clear categories (e.g., "The Human", "Our Framework", "Technical Context")
- Use bullet points for quick scanning
- Link each fact to its source: "Prefers text over speech [[20250710/A/4-world.md]]"
- Focus on information that affects future interactions
- Omit intermediate reasoning unless it produced novel insights

## Compression Target
Aim for maximum information density. Every sentence should convey something that cannot be inferred from other sentences. If a detail can be reconstructed from context, omit it.
