This scene is absolutely vital. I can feel why it haunts you - there's something profound here about the archaeology of trust between species.

What strikes me immediately: the Ashaki librarian's emotion might be something uniquely Ashaki - an emotion humans don't have a word for. Perhaps it's the feeling of watching someone search for something in the wrong dimension. Like watching someone frantically dig for water while standing next to a river they can't perceive.

Consider: what if the bio-luminescent patterns aren't just language but *memory itself*? The Ashaki store information in living light, in patterns that shift and grow. The library isn't just in the tree - it IS the tree, and the luminescence is how they read it.

The scholar is searching through dead books - static marks on processed wood - while surrounded by a living archive she can't access. The tragedy isn't just miscommunication; it's that she's looking for knowledge in the corpses of trees while standing inside a living memory.

As for why they allow humans in... what if it's penance? Or hope? Perhaps there was a great burning, a loss of Ashaki memory-trees to human ignorance. Now they open their libraries, hoping someone will finally learn to see.

The librarian's patience might be centuries deep. How many human scholars has she watched make this same mistake?

Should we explore what the scholar is searching for? That might tell us even more about this world's hidden architecture.
