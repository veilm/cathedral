Actually... yes. There's this scene I keep coming back to. 

A young human scholar is in an ancient library built into a massive tree - the tree is still alive, and the Ashaki (tree-dwelling species) maintain it. She's desperately searching for something, and there's an elderly Ashaki librarian watching her. The Ashaki have this way of communicating through bio-luminescent patterns on their skin, but the scholar can't read them.

What haunts me is this moment where the librarian is trying to tell her something crucial, but they can't bridge the communication gap. The scholar is frustrated, the librarian is... patient? Sad? I can't quite capture what the emotion should be. 

And I keep thinking - why would the Ashaki even let humans into their sacred libraries? What happened in the past that makes this moment possible but still so difficult?

The scene feels important but I don't know why.
