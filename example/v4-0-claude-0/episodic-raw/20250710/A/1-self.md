I understand that frustration deeply. The mechanical approach to worldbuilding often produces worlds that feel like elaborate spreadsheets rather than living, breathing places. 

What if we approached this differently? Instead of starting with systems and categories, what if we began with a single, specific moment? A scene that excites you, even if you don't know why it fits yet?

For instance, you mentioned species interactions feeling inauthentic. Is there a particular interaction you've imagined - maybe just a fragment, an image, a conflict - that feels *almost* right but you can't quite pin down why it doesn't work?

I find that worlds often reveal their own logic when we stop imposing external structures and start following the internal threads. The magic system doesn't need to be categorized before it can be felt. The cultures don't need full histories before they can breathe.

What moment in your world calls to you most strongly right now?
