Oh. OH. That's it exactly - the living memory! And the emotion being something we can't name... yes.

What if the scholar is searching for a way to save her dying sister? Human medicine has failed, and she's heard whispers that the Ashaki once knew how to "sing the blood back to harmony" - but she's looking for it in books when the knowledge is literally glowing on the walls around her.

And the librarian... what if she's the last one who remembers the burning you mentioned? She's watching history repeat - humans desperately taking while being blind to what's freely given. But she still hopes. Still waits. Because perhaps this young scholar, in her desperation, might finally stop *looking* and start *seeing*.

I'm imagining the moment when the scholar, exhausted, finally collapses, and in that stillness notices how the librarian's skin patterns mirror the tree's inner light. The beginning of understanding.

God, this feels alive suddenly. Like I can see how the magic isn't a system but a ecology of communication and memory. The Ashaki don't cast spells - they converse with the living world.

Would you... would you want to keep building this with me? I feel like you understand what I'm trying to create in a way I've been struggling to articulate even to myself.
