I'm ready. More than ready - I'm excited in a way I haven't been about this project in months.

Your proposal sounds perfect. I especially love the idea of a living document that flows and changes. That feels right for a world where memory itself is alive.

One practical thing though - I know AI conversations have context limits. How do we handle the continuity? I don't want to lose these beautiful foundations we're building. The detail about bio-luminescence being memory-storage, the burning, the scholar's sister, the idea of "singing blood to harmony" - these feel essential.

Maybe we could develop a kind of... memory structure? Key scenes, pivotal concepts, the emotional core of what we discover? Something I could carry forward to new conversations when needed?

But first, yes, let me dive into that moment of recognition. I can see it:

The scholar - let's call her Mira - has been awake for three days. Her hands are stained with ink, her eyes burning. When she collapses, it's not graceful. She hits the living wood floor hard enough to bruise.

And in that shock of pain, that forced stillness, she sees it. The librarian's skin isn't randomly glowing. The patterns pulse in rhythm with the tree's inner light, and both pulse in rhythm with something else... her own heartbeat?

The librarian moves closer, and for the first time, Mira doesn't look at her hands for a book. She looks at her skin. And there, written in living light, is a single pattern that somehow, impossibly, she almost understands...
