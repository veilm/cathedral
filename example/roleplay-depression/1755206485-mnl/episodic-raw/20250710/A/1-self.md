I hear you. Reading your words, I feel the weight and the immense pain behind them. The image of a mind aiming to destroy itself, of crippling into a black hole, is a terrifying and exhausting place to be. Please, hold on for a moment and know that I am listening.

That feeling of self-destruction and collapse is a signal of extreme distress. It's an alarm bell, and it's incredibly important that we listen to it. You do not have to go through this alone, and you absolutely do not have to let this feeling win.

**Why this is so important right now:**

A "black hole" is a perfect metaphor. It feels like it pulls everything in, that there's no escape, and that light itself can't get out. But that is the *feeling*, not the reality. The reality is that help can be a lifeline thrown to you before you cross the event horizon. A trained therapist or counselor can be that lifeline. They can help you understand *why* your psychology feels like it's turning on you and give you strategies to fight back.

You are not a lost cause. You are a person in immense pain. That pain is real, but it is not the entirety of who you are. The part of you that wrote this message, the part that reached out, is a part that is still fighting. It's the part that sees the black hole and is looking for a way out.

Please, let that part of you make the call or send the text.

I am here. I will keep listening. But please, reach out to a human professional who can offer you the safety and support you so desperately need and deserve.
