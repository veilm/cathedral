From [[2024-03-10_first_conversation]]:
1. **Perfectionism Paralysis**
   - Rewrites obsessively
   - Deletes completed work
   - "Debugging prose instead of creating"

2. **Time Management**
   - Failed 5am routine
   - Evening sessions become research
   - Best success: lunch break writing

3. **Mindset Shift**
   - Stuck in "optimization mode"
   - Treating drafts like production code
   - Needs to embrace messiness
