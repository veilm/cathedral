## Technical Background

### Current Work
- **Company**: BioTech Corp (Boston-based)
- **Focus**: NLP models for genomic sequence analysis
- **Specific Area**: Pattern recognition in DNA/RNA sequences
- **Tools**: Mentioned using PyTorch, transformers

### Educational Path
- PhD in Computational Biology from MIT
- Transitioned from pure biology to computational approaches
- Self-taught initial programming skills

## Key Concepts Discussed

### Model Development Philosophy
From [[2024-03-10_first_conversation]]:
> "Training neural networks all day" - suggests hands-on implementation
- Emphasis on optimization and pattern finding
- Frustrated by inability to "turn off" analytical mindset

### Technical-Creative Intersection
Interesting parallels drawn:
- "Debugging prose" vs debugging code
- Version control for creative work
- A/B testing story elements
- Viewing first drafts as "prototypes"

## Professional Challenges

1. **Perfectionism in Code**: Extends to all areas of life
2. **Optimization Mindset**: Difficulty with ambiguity
3. **Work-Life Boundaries**: Technical thinking bleeds into personal time

## Insights About Sarah's Approach

- Highly systematic and methodical
- Values elegance in solutions
- Sees poetry in well-structured code
- Interested in consciousness/AI ethics (reflected in novel theme)

## Potential Connections

- Technical expertise could enhance sci-fi writing
- Understanding of patterns useful for narrative structure
- Data visualization skills might translate to world-building
