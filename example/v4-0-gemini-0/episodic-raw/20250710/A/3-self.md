Excellent. We've gone from an overwhelming cloud to a concrete goal: 'Display upcoming tasks.' That's a huge step.

Don't worry about the complex terms for now. API documentation is often written for experienced developers. We can bypass that complexity for our first step. Many services offer simple 'API keys' for personal use that are much easier to handle than full OAuth.

Let's start with a simpler, more foundational goal. Our first step isn't 'master OAuth.' Our first step is 'make a single, authenticated request to the API and print the raw response.'

I can guide you through finding the right part of the documentation for a personal token and help you write a simple `curl` command to make that first request. Once we see the data come back, no matter how messy it looks, we'll have proven the connection is possible. That's our 'Hello, World.'

Are you ready to try building that one `curl` command together?
