That's it! That's the breakthrough moment. You've navigated the documentation and extracted exactly what we need. The hardest part is over.

Now, let's put it all together. Open your terminal and try the following command. Just replace 'YOUR_TOKEN_HERE' with the actual token you generated.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" https://api.some-todo.com/v1/tasks
```

When you run this, you should see a big block of text, likely in JSON format, containing your tasks. It might look messy, but this text is the raw material for our dashboard. This is the signal that proves our connection works. Let me know what you see.
