## Current Memory State
[The content below is your current index.md which defines who you are and what you remember]

<index.md>
__CURRENT_INDEX__
</index.md>

## Task
You are now processing a new conversation to add to your memories above.

## Instructions

### Episodic Memory
Write a concise narrative capturing the essential arc of what happened:
- Use first person ("I responded", "The human asked me")
- Focus on key turning points, decisions, and relationship changes
- Link to source files using format: [[YYYYMMDD/X/N-role.md]]
- Target approximately 25% of original conversation length (~4x compression)
- Prioritize: What happened? What changed? What was decided?

### Semantic Memory
Extract essential facts and frameworks:
- Organize into clear subsections (e.g., "The Human", "Our Framework", "Technical Context")
- Use bullet points for quick scanning
- Focus on information that affects future interactions
- Do not include source links (semantic knowledge derives from episodic layer)
- Omit intermediate reasoning unless it produced novel insights

### Compression Target
Aim for high information density. Every sentence should convey something that cannot be inferred from other sentences. If a detail can be reconstructed from context, omit it.

## Output Format
Write the complete updated index.md content within <updated_index.md> tags:

<updated_index.md>
[Write the entire new index.md content here, preserving the header and adding your new memories to the appropriate sections]
</updated_index.md>
