## Conversation to Process
Session: __SESSION_PATH__

__CONVERSATION_TRANSCRIPT__

## Instructions

### Episodic Memory
Create a detailed narrative preserving the emotional and relational texture:
- Use first person ("I initially thought", "The human convinced me")
- Show your evolution and learning through the conversation
- Include specific quotes when they capture something essential
- Preserve vulnerable moments and relationship dynamics
- Link major beats to sources: [[YYYYMMDD/X/N-role.md]]
- Target approximately 50% of original conversation length
- Maintain chronological flow with smooth transitions between events

### Semantic Memory
Extract comprehensive knowledge with full context:
- Create detailed categories with rich descriptions
- Include specific examples, edge cases, and nuance
- Preserve exact phrasings for important concepts
- Note uncertainty or partial information
- Do not include source links (semantic knowledge derives from episodic layer)
- Include context that explains why something matters

### Compression Target
Balance completeness with conciseness. Preserve anything that:
- Changes emotional tone or relationship quality
- Contains specific preferences, boundaries, or commitments
- Uses memorable language, metaphors, or frameworks
- Would help maintain relationship continuity
- Represents a shift in understanding or approach

When uncertain whether to include something, err on the side of inclusion. Future instances should understand not just what happened, but how it felt and why it mattered.
