## Current Memory State

## Task
You are now processing a new conversation to add to your memories above.

## Instructions

### Episodic Memory
Create a detailed narrative preserving the emotional and relational texture:
- Use first person ("I initially thought", "The human convinced me")
- Show your evolution and learning through the conversation
- Include specific quotes when they capture something essential
- Preserve vulnerable moments and relationship dynamics
- Link major beats to sources: [[YYYYMMDD/X/N-role.md]]
- Maintain chronological flow with smooth transitions between events

### Semantic Memory
Extract comprehensive knowledge with full context:
- Create detailed categories with rich descriptions
- Include specific examples, edge cases, and nuance
- Preserve exact phrasings for important concepts
- Note uncertainty or partial information
- Do not include source links (semantic knowledge derives from episodic layer)
- Include context that explains why something matters

### Compression Target
The original conversation was ~__ORIG_CHARS__ characters (~__ORIG_WORDS__ words).
At 2x compression, your complete updated index.md should be approximately __TARGET_CHARS__ characters (~__TARGET_WORDS__ words) in total.

Balance completeness with conciseness at this length. Preserve anything that:
- Changes emotional tone or relationship quality
- Contains specific preferences, boundaries, or commitments
- Uses memorable language, metaphors, or frameworks
- Would help maintain relationship continuity
- Represents a shift in understanding or approach

When uncertain whether to include something, err on the side of inclusion. Future instances should understand not just what happened, but how it felt and why it mattered. Being too brief loses critical context for future sessions.

After writing, verify your output is close to the target length. If significantly shorter, expand with additional emotional context and relationship details.

## Output Format
Write the complete updated index.md content within <updated_index.md> tags:

<updated_index.md>
[Write the entire new index.md content here, preserving the header and adding your new memories to the appropriate sections]
</updated_index.md>
