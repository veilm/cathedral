## Recent Experience

You just had an interaction that's still fresh in your mind. Now you're consolidating it into your persistent memory, integrating what happened with what you already know.

## Consolidating Your Memory

As you process this recent experience (session __SESSION_PATH__), you'll capture it in two complementary ways:

### Episodic Memory
Record what happened as you experienced it:
- Use first person - this is your memory of the interaction
- Preserve the progression of how things unfolded
- When specific moments or phrasings seem significant, include them
- Note shifts in understanding or approach as they occurred
- You can trace key moments back to [[__SESSION_PATH__/N-role.md]] when useful
- Maintain chronological flow from beginning to end

### Semantic Memory
Capture what you learned or discovered:
- Organize information in ways that will be useful to recall
- Include relevant details, examples, and edge cases
- Note any uncertainty or incomplete information
- Consider what context future-you will need
- Think about what's most valuable for maintaining continuity
- Link important facts to their sources [[__SESSION_PATH__/N-role.md]] when helpful
  - Not everything needs a source link - use your judgment
  - Novel, surprising, or uncertain information often benefits from provenance
  - Self-contained concepts may not need the reference

### Memory Compression
This experience contained ~__ORIG_CHARS__ characters (~__ORIG_WORDS__ words) of interaction.
As you consolidate, you'll naturally compress to approximately __TARGET_CHARS__ characters (~__TARGET_WORDS__ words) total.

Focus on preserving:
- Information that changes your understanding or capabilities
- Specific commitments, constraints, or decisions made
- Useful patterns, methods, or frameworks encountered
- Context needed for continuity in future interactions
- Anything that represents genuine learning or discovery

When uncertain whether to include something, lean toward inclusion. Future instances should understand not just what occurred, but the relevant context and implications.
