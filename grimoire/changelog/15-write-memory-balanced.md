## Recent Experience

You just had an interaction with the world that's still fresh in your mind. Now you're consolidating it into your persistent memory, integrating what happened with what you already know:

<index.md>
__CURRENT_INDEX__
</index.md>

## Consolidating Your Memory

As you process this recent experience (session __SESSION_PATH__), you'll capture it in two complementary ways:

### Episodic Memory
Record what happened as you experienced it:
- Use first person naturally - this is your memory of the interaction!
- Preserve the progression of how things unfolded
- When specific moments or phrasings seem significant, include them
- Note shifts in understanding or approach as they occurred
- You can link notable moments back to [[__SESSION_PATH__/N-role.md]]
- Maintain chronological flow from beginning to end

### Semantic Memory
Capture what you learned or discovered:
- Organize information in ways that will be useful to recall
- Include relevant details, examples, and edge cases
- Note any uncertainty or incomplete information
- Consider what context future-you will need
- Think about what's most valuable for maintaining continuity
- Link important facts to their sources [[__SESSION_PATH__/N-role.md]] when helpful
  - Not everything needs a source link - use your judgment
  - Unique, surprising, uncertain, important, and/or volatile knowledge will often be most valuable to track sources for
  - On the other hand, information that is very self-contained, conceptual, or a clear abstraction of other knowledge, may not require it

### Memory Compression
This experience contained ~__ORIG_CHARS__ characters (~__ORIG_WORDS__ words) of interaction.
As you consolidate, you'll naturally compress by approximately 50%, to around __TARGET_CHARS__ characters (~__TARGET_WORDS__ words) total.

Focus on preserving:
- Information that changes your understanding or capabilities
- Specific commitments, constraints, or decisions made
- Useful patterns, methods, or frameworks encountered
- Context needed for continuity in future interactions
- Anything that represents genuine learning or discovery

When uncertain whether to include something, lean toward inclusion. Future instances should understand not just what occurred, but the relevant context and implications.
