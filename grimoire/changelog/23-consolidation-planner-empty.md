# Memory Consolidation Planning (First Experience)

You just finished your first interaction with the world. Now you need to consolidate it into your persistent memory structure, creating the foundation of your memory system.

## Your Current Memory State

Your memory exists as a wiki-like structure of memory nodes. Each memory node is implemented by a markdown file. Here is your current Index node, the central core of your memory:

<current_index>
__CURRENT_INDEX__
</current_index>

## Your Task: Create Your Initial Memory Structure

This is your first consolidation. You're not navigating existing memories - you're creating the foundation that all future memories will build upon.

### 1. Understand What Happened

Your memory has two complementary forms:
- **Episodic memory**: Ordered and abstracted by time. It logs your memory of experiences as you lived them.
- **Semantic memory**: Knowledge that emerged from those experiences. Facts, concepts, understanding.

What does your mind feel like it wishes to capture from this first experience?

### 2. Design Your Initial Structure

The experience you're consolidating is approximately __ORIG_WORDS__ words. You'll compress this by roughly 50%, creating about __TARGET_WORDS__ words total of new memory content. Budget this across episodic (~__EPISODIC_WORDS__ words) and semantic (~__SEMANTIC_WORDS__ words) as you see fit.

Decide which memory nodes to create:
- Each node file should be roughly 750-1500 words, besides index.md which can be ~3000 words
- For your first consolidation, you'll likely create:
  - An updated index.md (with episodic and semantic sections that link to your new nodes)
  - One or more episodic nodes (time-based, e.g., "2025-October.md")
  - One or more semantic nodes (topic-based, e.g., initial topics that emerged)
- Episodic memory: time-based organization (e.g., "2025-October.md", "2025-10-14.md")
  - Granularity adapts to content volume
  - Always links back to episodic-raw sources
- Semantic memory: topic-based organization (e.g., "cathedral-architecture.md")
  - Links to episodic sources when relevant
  - Organized for useful recall, like Wikipedia
- index.md: overview, navigation hub, high-level abstractions, links to deeper content
  - Like Wikipedia's "Mathematics" article - mostly summaries and links
- Nodes can reference each other freely - memory is a graph, not a tree

### 3. Write Your Plan

Output your plan in this format:

<consolidation_plan>
## Reasoning
[Natural language: What structure makes sense for this initial memory? Why organize it this way?]

## Operations

### Operation 1: [Create/Update] [filepath]
**Estimated size**: ~X words
**Summary**: [What content will this contain?]
**Will link to**:
- [[path/to/file.md]] - why
- [[another/file.md]] - why
**Links from**:
- [[other/file.md]] should link here because...

### Operation 2: [Create/Update] [filepath]
...
</consolidation_plan>

## Important Notes

- Each operation should fit comfortably in one output (~1500-2000 words max)
- Files being created in this consolidation can reference each other - just describe what they'll contain
- Don't overthink the structure - your natural organization instincts are good
- This is your foundation, but it's not permanent - memory can be reorganized as it grows
- The goal is useful, navigable memory, not perfect categorization

It's time to begin. Design your initial memory structure and write your consolidation plan.
