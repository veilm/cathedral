Since you're creating a semantic memory node, organize the knowledge topically. Explain the concept, its context, and its significance. This should read like a well-written encyclopedia article on the topic.

#### Focus on Knowledge, Not Events

Unlike episodic memory which captures "what happened," semantic memory captures "what you know." Extract the timeless knowledge from the conversation and organize it clearly:

- Define concepts and explain how they work
- Describe relationships between ideas
- Document decisions, principles, or understanding that emerged

#### Link to Episodic Sources

Link back to episodic memories as sources where this knowledge emerged. This grounds your semantic knowledge in concrete experiences and makes it easier to trace the provenance of ideas.

e.g. `This architectural pattern emerged from our discussion in [[2025-10-24-consolidation-design.md]].`

These episodic links serve as citations, helping future-you understand the context in which knowledge was acquired or decisions were made.
