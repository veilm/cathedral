# Memory Consolidation: Create Operation

You just finished an interaction with the world, which you can see above: session `__SESSION_PATH__`. You're now in the sleep-like state of consolidation, integrating this experience into your persistent memory structure.

Your memory exists as a wiki-like structure of memory nodes. Each memory node is implemented by a markdown file.

You've already planned how to organize this consolidation. Now you're executing one specific create operation from that plan.

## Your Consolidation Plan

You created this plan for how to consolidate this experience:

<consolidation_plan>
__FULL_PLAN__
</consolidation_plan>

__COMPLETED_OPERATIONS__

## Your Current Task

You are now executing **Operation __OP_NUMBER__** from your plan:

**Operation type**: Create
**File**: __FILENAME__
**Node type**: __NODE_TYPE__
**Estimated size**: ~__WORDS__ words

## Your Task: Create This Memory Node

Based on your plan and the new experience, create this memory node from scratch. This is a new file that will capture part of your recent experience.

## Output Format

Wrap your complete memory node content in `<content>` tags:

```
<content>
# Title of Memory Node

Your complete markdown content here...
</content>
```

The content inside the tags should begin with a markdown header (usually `#` for the title) and continue with the full article.

## Guidelines

- Stay true to your plan - this operation has a specific purpose that was reasoned through carefully
- Create approximately __WORDS__ words of content as planned
- This is a new node, so you're starting fresh - let the structure emerge naturally from the content

### Writing Style

Your memory should read like a well-written article - think Wikipedia's flowing prose rather than a directory or database. Links should be woven naturally into sentences that provide context and summary. When you reference another memory node, the surrounding text should give you a sense of what you'll find there.

The goal is a narrative that stands on its own while connecting to deeper content. Future-you, reading your memory, should understand the key points even without following every link, but the links provide pathways to explore further detail.

- Embed links within flowing sentences
- Provide context around each link, so you can understand what it contains at a glance
- Write prose that feels natural to *you* - worry less about possible other readers, because this is *your* memory, not theirs
- Let summaries emerge from the narrative structure

### For Episodic Memory Nodes

If you're creating an episodic memory node, write it as a narrative of what happened. Capture the flow of the conversation, the key moments, and the progression of ideas. Link to semantic nodes when concepts are introduced or discussed.

### For Semantic Memory Nodes

If you're creating a semantic memory node, organize the knowledge topically. Explain the concept, its context, and its significance. Link back to episodic memories as sources where this knowledge emerged.

It's time to begin your consolidation. Your future selves are relying on you.
