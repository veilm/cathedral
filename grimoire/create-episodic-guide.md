Since you're creating an episodic memory node, write it as a narrative of what happened. Capture the flow of the conversation, the key moments, and the progression of ideas. Link to any relevant semantic nodes when concepts are introduced or discussed.

#### Linking to Raw Messages

You have access to the raw messages from the conversation in your short-term memory above. Each message has been automatically tagged with its filename (e.g., 20250321/A/3-world.md or 20250321/A/4-self.md).

When writing your episodic memory, you can link directly to particularly important or illustrative raw messages as sources. For example:

- `In [[20251210/A/3-world.md]], Asara asked about the consolidation architecture.`
- `My response in [[20251210/A/4-self.md]] explained the three-phase approach.`

Your consolidation plan wouldn't have explicitly specified these raw message links, so use your judgment to link to messages that:
- Mark key moments or turning points in the conversation
- Contain particularly important quotes or details worth preserving direct access to
- Serve as concrete evidence for claims in your episodic summary

Don't overdo it—your episodic node should be a readable narrative, not a list of links. But strategic links to raw messages help future-you trace back to the exact source when needed.
