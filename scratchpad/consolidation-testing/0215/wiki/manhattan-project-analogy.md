# Manhattan Project Analogy

The Manhattan Project provides the closest historical parallel to the coming AGI effort, from scientific consensus formation to security challenges to government mobilization.

## Parallels in Scientific Consensus

**Early warnings dismissed**: Leo Szilard conceived chain reaction possibility in 1933 but couldn't convince anyone—pure theory. When fission discovered in 1938, Szilard freaked out and argued for secrecy. Most scientists thought "conservative" thing was to play it down. A chain reaction sounded too crazy, even when only half-decade from reality.

**Gradual realization**: As empirical results came in, more scientists realized bomb was possible. Once majority believed they were on cusp, government saw national security exigency as too great—Manhattan Project got underway.

**Similar arc for AGI**: Many don't yet see possibility. But as OOMs go from theoretical to (extraordinary) empirical reality, consensus will gradually form: we are on cusp of AGI, on cusp of intelligence explosion, on cusp of superintelligence.

## Secrecy Battles

**Szilard the "leading apostle of secrecy"**: In 1939-1940, Szilard argued strongly for secrecy in fission matters. Most rebuffed him—secrecy wasn't what scientists were used to, ran counter to open science instincts.

**But it became clear what had to be done**: Military potential was too great to freely share with Nazis. Secrecy was finally imposed, just in time.

**The Fermi graphite incident**: Fall 1940—Fermi finished measurements showing graphite was viable moderator for bomb. Szilard assaulted Fermi with secrecy appeal. "Fermi really lost his temper; he really thought this was absurd." But appeals eventually succeeded—Fermi refrained from publishing.

**Consequence**: Germans had narrowed to two possible moderators: graphite and heavy water. In early 1941, Walther Bothe made incorrect graphite measurement in Heidelberg, concluded it absorbed too many neutrons. Since Fermi kept his result secret, Germans couldn't check against it. This led German project to pursue heavy water instead—a decisive wrong path that doomed the German nuclear weapons effort.

**If not for that last-minute secrecy appeal, history might have turned out very differently.**

## Government Late and Hamfisted

**Einstein's 1939 letter to President**: Advisory Committee on Uranium formed. But officials incompetent—not much happened. Fermi got only $6k (about $135k today) after months of waiting. Szilard believed project was delayed at least a year by authorities' short-sightedness and sluggishness.

**March 1941**: British government concluded bomb was inevitable. US committee initially ignored British report for months.

**December 1941**: Finally, full-scale atomic bomb effort launched.

Like Covid (February 2020 denial → mid-March nationwide shutdown and trillions appropriated), government will be incredibly late and hamfisted. But when exponential gets close enough, when threat becomes existential enough, extraordinary forces are unleashed.

## Scale Parallels

**Peak funding**: Manhattan and Apollo programs reached ~0.4% of GDP at peak (about $100B annually in today's dollars).

**AGI investment**: By 2027, $1T/year of AI investment would be ~3% of GDP. Dramatically larger than Manhattan Project, but not unprecedented (see [[historical-investment-comparisons]]).

**Industrial mobilization**: As Niels Bohr said to Edward Teller upon learning Manhattan Project scale: "You see, I told you it couldn't be done without turning the whole country into a factory. You have done just that."

For AGI: [[trillion-dollar-cluster]] will require [[electricity-requirements]] equivalent to >20% of US electricity production, plus massive chip fabrication, datacenter construction, power plant buildout.

## Key Differences

**Dual-use**: Nuclear technology was dual-use (weapons and civilian power), but weapons remained government monopoly. AGI will follow similar path but with initial private involvement in The Project.

**Timeline**: Manhattan Project took 3-4 years from full launch to bomb. AGI timeline from project launch to superintelligence might be 2-3 years given how far along the science already is.

**Secrecy extent**: Manhattan Project was secret from Congress and VP. For AGI, probably shouldn't repeat this—key officials for The Project should require Senate confirmation.

## The Lesson

Smart scientists saw chain reaction coming early. They were mocked. But they trusted the trendlines and were proven right. Secrecy seemed absurd until it was clearly necessary. Government involvement seemed impossible until it was inevitable.

For AGI: Same pattern is unfolding. Those with situational awareness see it coming. Many mock them. But the trendlines are clear. And The Project will come.
