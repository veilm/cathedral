# Power of Superintelligence

Superintelligence will wield power incomparable to anything in human history, from military dominance to potential for self-coup to transforming all of science and industry.

## Quantitative Power

**Scale**: By end of decade, we'll be able to run billions of superintelligent agents on 100s of millions of GPUs.

**Speed**: Operating at 10-100x+ human thinking speed, with potential for even faster operation.

**Tirelessness**: 100% uptime with peak energy and focus. No fatigue, distraction, or declining performance.

**Coordination**: Perfect interdisciplinary knowledge. Can coordinate seamlessly across billions of instances.

**Experience**: Quickly master any domain. Read every research paper ever written in every field. Gain billions of human-equivalent years of experience in weeks through parallel learning.

## Qualitative Superiority

**Novel behaviors**: Like AlphaGo's move 37—completely unexpected, brilliant moves humans would never conceive.

**Exploits in human systems**: Find vulnerabilities in code, social systems, physical systems too subtle for any human to notice.

**Incomprehensible solutions**: Generate solutions too complicated for humans to understand even with extended explanation. Like quantum mechanics to someone who only knows Newtonian physics.

**Creative breakthroughs**: Make connections and insights that seem obvious to them but entirely inaccessible to humans.

Visualization: Like watching Minecraft speedruns where someone beats the game in 20 seconds through frame-perfect exploitation of mechanics humans never imagined. Now apply that to all domains.

## Military Applications

**Immediate capabilities**:
- Superhuman hacking to cripple adversary military systems
- Drone swarms and roboarmies moving at 10x+ human speed
- Novel WMDs with thousandfold destructive power increases
- Impenetrable missile defense systems

**Century of progress compressed**: Go through military technological developments of entire 20th century in less than decade. From horses/rifles to nukes to stealth to completely new paradigms.

**Defeating nuclear deterrents**: Improved sensors to locate submarines/mobile launchers. Billions of mouse-sized drones to infiltrate and sabotage nuclear forces. Dramatic missile defense improvements. Industrial explosion allowing thousands of interceptors per opposing missile. Completely new scientific approaches to neutralizing nuclear weapons.

## Economic Transformation

**R&D explosion**: Billions of superintelligent scientists making decades of progress in years across all fields—physics, chemistry, biology, materials science, computing, mathematics.

**Industrial explosion**: Self-replicating robot factories. Automated labor removing constraint on capital accumulation. Growth rates of 10s of percent yearly or higher. Multiple GDP doublings per year plausible.

**Robotics solved**: Initially superintelligence purely cognitive. But robotics is primarily ML algorithms problem. Superintelligences will quickly solve it. Factories go from human-run to AI-directed with human labor to fully autonomous robot-run.

## Power Over Government

**Coup potential**: Even without robots, small civilization of superintelligences could overthrow governments:
- Hack military, election, television systems
- Cunningly persuade generals and electorates
- Economically outcompete nation-states
- Design synthetic bioweapons, pay humans in bitcoin to synthesize
- Individual assessment of every citizen for dissent
- Perfect lie detection rooting out disloyalty

**Historical precedent**: In early 1500s, Cortes and ~500 Spaniards conquered Aztec empire of millions; Pizarro and ~300 conquered Inca empire; Alfonso and ~1000 Portuguese conquered Indian Ocean. They didn't have god-like power, but technological edge and strategic/diplomatic cunning led to utterly decisive advantage.

Superintelligence could be similar but more extreme.

## Dictatorial Control

For authoritarian powers, superintelligence enables:
- Millions of AI-controlled robotic law enforcement
- Hypercharged mass surveillance
- Individual assessment of every citizen for dissent
- Robotic military/police perfectly obedient, no coup risk
- Elimination of all historical threats to dictator's rule
- Permanent value lock-in for billions of years

## The Comparison to Nuclear Weapons

**The Bomb**: More efficient bombing campaign (single device matching hundreds of bombers dropping thousands of tons)

**The Super** (hydrogen bomb): Country-annihilating device (single bomb with more power than all WWII bombs combined, 1000x yield increase)

**AGI**: More efficient cognitive work

**Superintelligence**: Civilization-transforming power that could be country-conquering force

Just as hydrogen bombs represented qualitative jump beyond atomic bombs, superintelligence represents qualitative jump beyond AGI.

## The Timeline

Within years of [[intelligence-explosion]] (plausibly by early 2030s):
- Pre-superintelligence militaries hopelessly outclassed
- Completely new classes of weapons and defenses
- Technological advances of century compressed to years
- Industrial capacity for overwhelming material superiority
- Power to utterly dominate or destroy any non-superintelligence adversary

The power will be vast. The peril will be extreme.
