# Trillion-Dollar Cluster

The trillion-dollar cluster represents the projected ~2030 training cluster on current trends—an unprecedented engineering and industrial mobilization.

## Specifications

- **Cost**: ~$1 trillion
- **GPUs**: ~100 million H100-equivalents
- **Power**: ~100 GW (>20% of current US electricity production)
- **Scale comparison**: More expensive than the International Space Station ($150B)

## Timeline to Build

Assuming continuation of historical ~0.5 OOMs/year growth in training compute:
- **2022**: GPT-4 cluster (~$500M-1B)
- **2024**: +1 OOM cluster (~$2-5B)
- **2026**: +2 OOMs cluster (~$10s of billions)
- **2028**: +3 OOMs cluster (~$100s of billions)
- **2030**: +4 OOMs cluster (~$1T+)

Each step represents roughly 10x more compute than the previous generation.

## Physical Infrastructure

**Not just a warehouse with GPUs**, but:
- Hundreds of power plants or equivalent electricity supply
- Massive natural gas extraction (~1,200 new wells for 100 GW)
- $100B+ in power generation infrastructure alone
- Advanced cooling systems at unprecedented scale
- Networking infrastructure for 100M+ GPUs
- Physical security on par with most secure military bases

## Power Sources

If using natural gas:
- Marcellus/Utica shale produces ~36 BCF/day currently
- Can generate ~150 GW continuously (250 GW with combined cycle)
- Requires ~40 rigs operating for <1 year to build production base
- Total US natural gas production doubling again (as it did in previous decade) could support multiple trillion-dollar clusters

## Why It Might Happen

**Economic justification**: White-collar workers paid tens of trillions annually worldwide. A drop-in remote worker automating even a fraction of cognitive jobs would pay for the trillion-dollar cluster.

**National security**: Even if economics are uncertain, national security import could motivate government project bundling national resources (see [[the-project]]).

**Historical precedent**: Not unprecedented in scale—comparable to:
- British railway investments (1841-1850): ~40% of GDP over decade (~$11T equivalent)
- Wartime borrowing: UK/France/Germany borrowed >100% of GDP in WWI; UK/Japan >100% in WWII
- China investment: 40%+ of GDP for two decades (~$11T/year at US GDP scale)

## Likely Uses

This may not be for AGI (which likely needs only ~$100B cluster by 2028) but rather for:
- Training and running superintelligence after [[intelligence-explosion]]
- Training AGI if AGI is harder than expected
- Running billions of [[superintelligence-definition]] instances post-AGI

By 2030, whoever controls the trillion-dollar cluster likely controls the most powerful technology—and weapon—mankind has ever built.

## Who Will Build It

Critical question: Will it be built in America or elsewhere? Current trajectory risks it being built in Middle Eastern autocracies. The [[national-security-imperative]] demands it be built in the US or close democratic allies.
