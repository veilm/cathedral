# AGI Definition and Timeline

Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) refers to AI systems capable of fully automating the work of AI researchers and engineers, not merely advanced chatbots or narrow AI systems.

## Key Timeline Prediction

The essay series argues AGI by 2027 is "strikingly plausible" based on trend extrapolation rather than science fiction. This prediction rests on continuing the GPT-2 to GPT-4 trajectory, which took systems from ~preschooler to ~smart high-schooler abilities in 4 years (2019-2023).

## What Counts as AGI

AGI means AI systems that could fully automate cognitive jobs, particularly the work of AI researchers themselves. This includes:
- Writing and debugging complex code across entire codebases
- Reading and internalizing the entire ML literature
- Designing and running experiments independently
- Making algorithmic breakthroughs

The definition explicitly avoids "downward-defining AGI" as merely better chatbots. While some areas like robotics might lag, once models can automate AI research itself, that's sufficient to kick off intense feedback loops toward [[superintelligence-definition]].

## Capability Benchmarks

By 2027, models are expected to:
- Outperform PhDs and expert researchers in their domains
- Function as "drop-in remote workers" rather than mere tools
- Handle million-line codebases and week-long projects autonomously
- Demonstrate qualitatively superhuman performance in many domains while potentially remaining uneven in others

The timeline assumes roughly ~5 [[orders-of-magnitude-scaling]] of [[effective-compute-growth]] from GPT-4 to 2027 models, combining physical compute scaling, [[algorithmic-progress]], and [[unhobbling-gains]].
