# Drop-In Remote Workers

The milestone marking AGI arrival: AIs that can do the job of AI researchers/engineers, remotely, with minimal onboarding, soon turning into millions of automated workers.

## The Definition

**Drop-in remote worker**: An AI that can:
- Perform the job of an AI researcher or engineer
- Work remotely with minimal onboarding (like a human remote hire)
- Operate with similar autonomy to human worker
- Scale to millions of copies working in parallel

This is the practical, economically-grounded definition of AGI used throughout the analysis.

## Why This Matters

**Economic signal**: When AIs can do the most economically valuable jobs (AI research/engineering), we've crossed into AGI territory.

**Recursive improvement**: AI researchers who can improve AI systems create feedback loop leading to [[intelligence-explosion]].

**Scalability**: Unlike human workers, can be copied millions of times and run at 10-100x human speed, creating [[automated-ai-research]] at unprecedented scale.

## Current Progress

**GPT-4 level**: Can write code, understand technical concepts, but:
- Needs heavy scaffolding and human oversight
- Makes mistakes frequently
- Lacks long-horizon planning and autonomy
- Can't reliably complete complex multi-step projects

**Trajectory**: Each OOM of scaling brings us closer. By ~2027 (per [[agi-definition-and-timeline]]), models should reach drop-in remote worker capability for AI research tasks.

## What Changes At This Threshold

**Before**: AI as tool amplifying human productivity. Humans in the loop for all important decisions.

**After**: AI as autonomous agent. Millions working in parallel on AI research. Humans increasingly relegated to high-level direction.

**Feedback loop**: Once AI can do AI research, it can improve itself, leading to exponential acceleration.

## The Test

How do you know when you have drop-in remote workers?

**Practical test**: Can you hire them the same way you'd hire human remote worker? Give them tasks, check in periodically, and they deliver results comparable to competent human engineer?

**Economic test**: Are companies actually replacing significant fractions of their technical workforce with AI workers?

**Capability test**: Can they autonomously navigate codebases, debug complex issues, design systems, and handle unexpected complications?

## Implications For Timeline

**Conservative estimate**: Even if we just extrapolate current trends with no major breakthroughs, we get there by 2027.

**Accelerated scenario**: If [[algorithmic-progress]] on [[data-wall]] succeeds dramatically, could arrive sooner.

**Delayed scenario**: If major obstacles emerge in translating benchmark performance to autonomous agent capability, could take longer.

But base case: This decade, likely within next 2-3 years.

## What Happens Next

Once you have drop-in remote workers for AI research:

**Month 1**: Deploy thousands of AI researchers working on next generation
**Month 3**: First improvements from AI-designed algorithms and architectures
**Month 6**: 100,000+ AI researchers, major capabilities jump
**Month 12**: Millions of AI researchers, superintelligence emerging

See [[intelligence-explosion]] for detailed timeline.

## Why "Remote" Matters

**No robotics required**: Don't need to solve embodiment, manipulation, or physical interaction. Pure software task.

**Infrastructure exists**: All the tools are already digital—codebases, GPUs, communication platforms.

**Immediate deployment**: Can spin up millions of instances as soon as capability threshold is reached.

This is why AI research is the critical automation target. It's the job that both (1) is most feasible to automate soon and (2) unlocks everything else.

## The Economically-Grounded View

Rather than philosophical debates about consciousness or general intelligence, focus on:
- Can it do economically valuable work?
- Can it work autonomously like remote employee?
- Can it be deployed at massive scale?

If yes to all three for AI research jobs, we have AGI—regardless of whether it "truly understands" or has "real intelligence."

## Implications For Organizations

AI labs will transition from:
- Hundreds of human researchers (current)
- Thousands of human researchers + AI assistance (near-term)
- Humans + millions of AI researchers (AGI threshold)
- Millions of AI researchers + small human oversight (superintelligence)

Organizations that successfully make this transition first will achieve decisive advantage.
