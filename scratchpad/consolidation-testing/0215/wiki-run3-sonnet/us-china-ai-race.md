# US-China AI Race

The race between the United States and China to develop AGI and superintelligence represents a fundamental competition for global economic and military preeminence.

## Current State

**US leads but China is viable:**
- Leading AI labs in US and UK (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind)
- US tech companies making much bigger AI bets
- Chinese LLMs at best comparable to second-tier US labs (Yi-Large is GPT-4-class but over a year late)
- Many Chinese models are "mere ripoffs" of US open source (Yi-34B essentially Llama2 architecture with few lines changed)

**But counting China out is premature.** Like Google in early 2023 (looked far behind OpenAI, then woke up and became serious competitor within 18 months), China has clear path to competitiveness once CCP mobilizes.

## China's Path to Competitiveness

**1. Compute - Outbuild the US:**

*Chips*: China demonstrated ability to manufacture 7nm chips (SMIC). Huawei Ascend 910B (7nm) only ~2-3x worse on performance/$ than Nvidia equivalent. While yields and scale are debated, plausibly could produce at large scale in few years. 7nm is sufficient (A100s used 7nm). Even 3x more expensive chips wouldn't hugely increase total datacenter costs.

*Industrial mobilization*: If there's one thing China does better than US, it's building stuff. In last decade, China built as much new electricity capacity as entire US capacity (while US capacity flat). In US, projects stuck in environmental review and permitting for decade. China can likely outbuild US on largest training clusters, especially the [[electricity-requirements]] for 100GW+ clusters.

**2. Algorithms - Steal from US:**

Western labs likely well ahead algorithmically, with advantage equivalent to 10x-100x bigger cluster. But on current course, this advantage will be completely surrendered. As discussed in [[algorithmic-secrets-security]], current AI lab security makes it trivial for China to steal key breakthroughs. Unless labs locked down very soon, China will steal key algorithmic ingredients for AGI and match US capabilities.

Even worse: If security isn't improved, China could steal AGI weights directly and launch their own [[intelligence-explosion]].

## When China Wakes Up

As we race through the OOMs, as leaps continue (PhDs-level AI by 2025/26, $10T valuations, trillion-dollar clusters), CCP will take note. Just as these leaps will wake up USG to AGI, they'll wake up CCP to AGI—and to what being behind on AGI would mean for their national power.

Once CCP mobilizes, expect:
- Extraordinary national effort
- Massive resource commitment
- Potential willingness to apply less caution than US (both reasonable and unreasonable caution/regulation)
- Formidable adversary

## Why The Race Matters

**Military advantage**: Superintelligence would provide decisive military advantage (see [[military-advantages-of-superintelligence]]). Lead of year or two could mean complete dominance, comparable to Gulf War where US-led coalition obliterated Iraqi army despite numerical parity.

**Authoritarian peril**: CCP with superintelligence could use it for world conquest and enforce total internal control. Superintelligence could eliminate all historical threats to dictator's rule—no more coups or rebellions with AI-controlled robotic police and military. Could lock in Party's conception of "truth" totally and completely, potentially for billions of years.

**Safety margin**: Tight race means existential race through intelligence explosion at breakneck pace. No margin to slow down for safety. A 2-year vs. 2-month lead makes difference between manageable safety challenges and catastrophic pressure forcing us to barrel ahead regardless of risks.

## The Stakes

At stake is not just advantage in proxy wars, but whether freedom and democracy survive the next century. Twice in 20th century tyranny threatened globe. AGI race may determine if authoritarianism or democracy prevails for the long-term future of civilization.

The free world must prevail.
