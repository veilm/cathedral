# Authoritarian Peril

Superintelligence in the hands of authoritarian powers would enable permanent dictatorial control and potentially world conquest, representing an existential threat to freedom and democracy.

## Concentrated Power Unlike Any Before

A dictator wielding superintelligence would command power incomparable to anything in history:

**Perfect internal control:**
- Millions of AI-controlled robotic law enforcement agents policing populace
- Mass surveillance hypercharged beyond current capabilities
- Dictator-loyal AIs individually assessing every citizen for dissent
- Advanced near-perfect lie detection rooting out any disloyalty
- Robotic military and police wholly controlled by single political leader
- Perfectly obedient forces programmed never to coup or rebel

**Permanence**: Past dictatorships were never permanent—eventually coups, rebellions, or succession crises ended them. Superintelligence could eliminate basically all historical threats to dictator's rule and lock in their power.

**Value lock-in**: If CCP gets this power, they could enforce the Party's conception of "truth" totally and completely—not just for decades but potentially for billions of years.

## The CCP Regime

The Chinese Communist Party is:
- Founded on continued worship of perhaps greatest totalitarian mass-murderer in history (Mao: 40-80M victims from starvation, persecution, prison labor, mass executions)
- Recently put million Uyghurs in concentration camps
- Crushed free Hong Kong
- Systematically practices mass surveillance (phone tracking, DNA databases, facial recognition, citizen-informant armies)
- Ensures all text messages pass through censor
- Pulls families into police stations when child overseas attends protest
- Cemented Xi Jinping as dictator-for-life
- Explicitly aims to militarily crush and "reeducate" free Taiwan
- Explicitly seeks China-centric world order

This is the regime that could wield superintelligence.

## Why Democratic Values Matter

"I believe in freedom and democracy, strongly, because I don't know what the right values are."

The author argues for freedom not because "our values are better" but because:
- In long arc of history, "time has upset many fighting faiths"
- Should place faith in mechanisms of error correction, experimentation, competition, adaptation
- Superintelligence gives those who wield it power to crush opposition and lock in their grand plan
- Better to preserve raucous plurality that has defined American experiment than risk permanent value lock-in by those certain they're right

## Historical Context

"By far the most common political system in history is authoritarianism." Freedom and democracy are not guaranteed. They are fragile accomplishments requiring defense.

Twice in 20th century, tyranny threatened globe. We must not delude ourselves that this threat is banished forever. For many young people, freedom feels like a given—but it is not.

## The Stakes in AGI Race

At stake is not just advantage in some proxy war, but whether freedom and democracy can survive for next century and beyond.

CCP intentions unclear, but:
- History of dictators of their ilk is not pretty
- We owe our peace and freedom to American economic and military preeminence
- If America and allies fail to win this race, we risk it all
- Even if CCP doesn't actively conquer, superintelligence-enabled permanent authoritarianism would dominate world order

## International World Conquest

Superintelligence provides tools for world domination:
- Decisive [[military-advantages-of-superintelligence]]
- Economic dominance through growth explosion
- Ability to enforce will on other countries
- Novel WMDs and offensive capabilities
- Defensive capabilities making homeland impregnable

The power differential would resemble early 1500s: Cortes and 500 Spaniards conquered Aztec empire of millions; Pizarro and 300 conquered Inca empire; Alfonso and 1000 Portuguese conquered Indian Ocean. They didn't have god-like power, but technological edge and strategic cunning led to utterly decisive advantage.

## The Temptation

Even democracies will face terrible temptation to use superintelligence's power to enforce their vision. Hope is that we can rely on wisdom of the Framers—letting radically different values flourish, preserving plurality through checks and balances and democratic institutions.

But authoritarian powers have no such constraints. They would wield this power without hesitation.

## Why The Free World Must Prevail

The free world's survival is at stake. We cannot let authoritarian powers win the race to superintelligence. American leadership in developing AGI is not just desirable—it's existentially necessary for preserving freedom and democracy.
