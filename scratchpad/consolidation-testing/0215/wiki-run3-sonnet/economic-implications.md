# Economic Implications

Superintelligence will drive an economic explosion, with growth rates potentially reaching 10s of percent annually or higher—a fundamental regime shift comparable to the Industrial Revolution.

## AI Revenue Trajectory

**Current (2024)**:
- OpenAI: $1B run rate (August 2023) → $2B (February 2024) = doubling every 6 months
- Microsoft: ~$5B incremental AI revenue already
- GPT-4 cluster ($500M) easily paid off by billions in annual revenue

**Near-term (~2025-2026)**:
- $10B+ annual run rate expected for Microsoft/OpenAI by late 2024/early 2025
- Key milestone: When will big tech hit $100B revenue run rate from AI?
- Naive doubling-every-6-months extrapolation suggests mid-2026

**Why $100B is achievable**:
- 350M paid Microsoft Office subscribers exist
- Get 1/3 to pay $100/month for AI add-on = $100B+ annually
- Only needs few hours/month of productivity gains to justify
- Models powerful enough for this seem very doable in next couple years

## Market Implications

**Stock market effects**:
- AI products become biggest revenue driver for America's largest corporations
- Forecasts of overall revenue growth skyrocket
- First $10T company possibly soon after $100B milestone
- Big tech willing to invest hundreds of billions each into further scaleout
- First many-hundred-billion-dollar corporate bond sale

**Nvidia example**: Datacenter sales exploded from ~$14B annualized to ~$90B annualized in last year. Mainstream analysts still think 2024 might be peak. Reality: Nvidia will do $200B+ revenue in CY25.

## The Automation Wave

White-collar workers paid tens of trillions annually worldwide. A drop-in remote worker automating even fraction of cognitive jobs would pay for [[trillion-dollar-cluster]].

**Progression**:
- Early: AI copilots providing productivity boosts (harder to integrate, workflow changes needed)
- Later: Drop-in remote workers (much easier—just onboard like human hire)
- Endpoint: Full automation of all remotely-doable work

The "sonic boom" effect: Intermediate models require tons of schlep to integrate and derive value from. Drop-in remote workers will be dramatically easier to integrate—just drop them in to automate remotely-doable jobs. Economic value jump could be somewhat discontinuous.

## Industrial Explosion (Post-Superintelligence)

Why isn't "factorio-world" (factories building factories building more factories until planet covered) possible today?

**Current constraint**: Labor is constrained. Can accumulate capital (factories, tools), but this hits diminishing returns because constrained by fixed labor force.

**Superintelligence removes constraint**: With robots and AI automating labor, robo-factories could produce more robo-factories in unconstrained way, leading to industrial explosion.

**Growth rate projections**:
- Current: 2%/year real GDP growth
- Post-superintelligence: 30%/year and beyond, quite possibly multiple doublings per year
- Not just 2% → 2.5%, but fundamental shift in growth regime

This follows from economists' models: When capital can accumulate without labor constraint, explosive growth becomes possible.

## Historical Growth Regime Shifts

Table from Robin Hanson's work:

| Growth mode | Date began to dominate | Doubling time (years) |
|------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Hunting | 2,000,000 B.C. | 230,000 |
| Farming | 4700 B.C. | 860 |
| Science/commerce | 1730 A.D. | 58 |
| Industry | 1903 A.D. | 15 |
| Superintelligence? | 2030 A.D.? | ??? |

Each transition dramatically accelerated pace of economic growth. Superintelligence could kick off another regime shift.

## Frictions and Delays

Societal frictions may slow GDP statistics:
- Arcane regulation (lawyers and doctors must be human even if AI much better)
- Resistance to pace of change (sand in gears of rapidly expanding robo-factories)
- Preference for human workers in some domains (nannies, etc.)

But in domains where human-created barriers removed (e.g., military production due to competition), we'd see industrial explosion in full force.

## Reference Class Investments

**Telecoms (1996-2001)**: Nearly $1T in today's dollars building internet infrastructure

**British railways (1841-1850)**: ~40% of British GDP = ~$11T equivalent over decade at US GDP scale

**China investment**: 40%+ of GDP for two decades = ~$11T/year at US GDP scale

**Wartime borrowing**: UK/France/Germany borrowed >100% of GDP in WWI; UK/Japan >100% in WWII

$1T/year AI investment by 2027 would be dramatic—among very largest capital buildouts ever—but not unprecedented.
