# The Project

The Project refers to the inevitable government involvement in AGI development—a national consortium bringing together AI labs, cloud providers, and the national security state to build superintelligence.

## Why It's Inevitable

Once technology becomes this important for national security, it won't remain a private startup endeavor. The USG will not let a random SF startup develop superintelligence any more than it would have let Uber develop atomic bombs.

Superintelligence will be:
- The most powerful weapon mankind has ever built
- Locus of international competition where months of lead could be decisive
- Source of decisive military advantage
- Key to economic and military predominance by end of decade

This summons primordial national security forces. The delusion: that AI lab leaders can control destiny of what they're building. Reality: in a few years, the world will wake up, and the national security state will take the helm.

## Timeline

**~2026-2027**: As we race through more OOMs, consensus forms among leading scientists, executives, officials that we are on cusp of AGI. Mood in Washington becomes somber. The question rings through Pentagon halls and Congressional briefings: "Do we need an AGI Manhattan Project?"

**~2027-2028**: By late 26/27/28, The Project will be underway. Core AGI research team moves to secure location. Trillion-dollar cluster built in record speed. The Project is on.

The path will be late and hamfisted (like Covid response, like Manhattan Project initially), but once the exponential gets close enough, extraordinary forces will be unleashed.

## Structure (Plausible Form)

Not necessarily literal nationalization, but more sophisticated orchestration:

- **Relationship with DoD**: Like Boeing or Lockheed Martin relationship—defense contracting or similar
- **Joint venture**: Major cloud providers + AI labs + government
- **"Voluntary" merger**: AI labs may "voluntarily" agree to merge in national effort (like "voluntary" White House commitments in 2023)
- **Congressional involvement**: Trillions of investment requires Congressional appropriation
- **Checks and balances**: For democratic legitimacy and control

Functionally becomes project of the national security state, even if nominally involving private companies.

## Why Private Labs Aren't Enough

**National defense project**: Superintelligence will be US's most important defense project. Can't be under unilateral command of random CEO—would be like Elon Musk having final command of nuclear arsenal.

**Security**: Only government can provide security against state-actor threats. Private labs are basically handing AGI secrets to CCP. Requires government infrastructure: vetting, physical security, NSA expertise, authority to imprison for leaks.

**Safety**: Startups have commercial incentives to race. Need ability to coordinate, "spend our lead" if necessary, make hard tradeoffs. Will face incredibly high-stakes decisions during fog-of-war of intelligence explosion. Need chain of command with appropriate seriousness.

**International stabilization**: Need government to bundle Western efforts, ensure trillion-dollar buildouts happen in US, protect datacenters against sabotage/attack, develop and enforce nonproliferation regime.

**Sane chain of command**: Hundreds of years of institutions, checks and balances, norms of liberal democratic order. Tested ability to check government power. US military could already kill every civilian if it wanted—we keep it in check through these institutions, not through many private nuclear arsenals.

## Key Free Variables

**When**: Does government realize what's happening before intelligence explosion, or only during? Earlier is better—need couple years for security crash program, getting officials up to speed, building functioning merged lab.

**International coalition**:
- Tighter alliance (like Quebec Agreement): US + UK (DeepMind) + Japan/South Korea (chips) + NATO core allies
- Broader benefit-sharing (like Atoms for Peace / NPT): Offer peaceful benefits to wider group in exchange for non-proliferation commitments

**Competence**: How will it be organized? What do checks and balances look like? What is sane chain of command? Almost no attention has gone to figuring this out. **This is the ballgame.**

## Civilian Applications

Nuclear technology path is instructive:
- Chain reaction first harnessed as government project
- Nuclear weapons permanently reserved for government
- But civilian nuclear energy flourished privately (until environmentalists shut it down)

Similarly for Boeing (B-29, B-47, B-52 for military → 707 civilian jet), radar, satellites, rockets, gene technology, WWII factories.

Initial superintelligence development dominated by national security exigency. Military uses remain reserved for government. But once initial peril passed and world stabilized, companies pursue civilian applications privately. Even with The Project, private, pluralistic, market-based ecosystem of civilian superintelligence applications will have its day.
