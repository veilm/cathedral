# AGI Timeline

AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) is projected to arrive by 2027 based on extrapolation of current deep learning trends, according to analysis published in June 2024.

## Key Timeline Milestones

The progression from GPT-2 (2019) to projected AGI follows a pattern of consistent capability increases every ~4 years:

- **GPT-2 (2019)**: ~preschooler-level abilities, could barely string together coherent sentences
- **GPT-3 (2020)**: ~elementary school level, began showing commercial utility
- **GPT-4 (2023)**: ~smart high-schooler level, acing standardized tests and demonstrating sophisticated reasoning
- **Projected AGI (2027)**: Expected to fully automate cognitive work, functioning as expert-level drop-in remote workers

## Basis for Timeline

The 2027 projection rests on three converging trends continuing at historical rates:

1. **Compute scaling**: ~0.5 OOMs (orders of magnitude) per year increase in training compute
2. **Algorithmic efficiency**: ~0.5 OOMs per year in effective compute gains from better algorithms
3. **Unhobbling gains**: Systematic removal of artificial limitations (transitioning from chatbot to agent capabilities)

Together, these trends suggest another 100,000x effective compute increase from GPT-4 to 2027, producing a qualitative capability jump comparable to GPT-2 → GPT-4.

## Post-AGI: Intelligence Explosion

Once AGI can automate AI research itself, an [[intelligence-explosion]] becomes possible. Millions of automated AI researchers working at superhuman speed could compress a decade of algorithmic progress into ≤1 year, rapidly producing [[superintelligence]].

This creates a condensed timeline where 2027 AGI could lead to vastly superhuman systems by 2028-2030.

## Critical Period Characteristics

The timeline creates several unique pressures:

- Very little time for iterative safety testing as systems rapidly become superhuman
- Compressed decision-making windows for high-stakes choices
- Potential overlap with geopolitical flashpoints (Taiwan invasion timelines also cluster around 2027)
- Limited margin for error in [[ai-security]] and [[superalignment]] preparations

## "This Decade or Bust"

The 2020s represent an unusually rapid traversal through orders of magnitude of progress (~10 OOMs this decade vs. ~1-1.5 OOMs/decade from historical Moore's Law). This concentration occurs due to one-time gains from:

- Spending scaleup (from millions to hundreds of billions per cluster)
- Hardware specialization for AI (exhausting gains from chip adaptation)
- Algorithmic research investment surge (limited by talent pool saturation)

Progress will likely slow substantially in the 2030s, making AGI either a 2020s phenomenon or potentially much further out.
