# Superintelligence

Superintelligence refers to AI systems vastly smarter than humans—qualitatively different from human intelligence, not just quantitatively superior. Expected by 2028-2030 following the [[intelligence-explosion]].

## Definition and Characteristics

### Quantitatively Superhuman

By end of decade, could run **billions of superintelligent agents** on 100s of millions of GPUs:

**Speed advantages**:
- "Think" orders of magnitude faster than humans
- Work 100% of time with peak energy and focus
- No coordination overhead from human limitations
- Each instance has access to parallel experience of all copies

**Capability advantages**:
- Quickly master any domain
- Write trillions of lines of code
- Read every research paper ever written (perfectly interdisciplinary)
- Write new papers before human gets past abstract of one
- Gain billions of human-equivalent years of experience in weeks

### Qualitatively Superhuman

More important but harder to imagine:

**Example from existing systems**: AlphaGo's move 37 vs. Lee Sedol—completely novel, creative behavior beyond human understanding from large-scale RL.

**Future superintelligence across all domains**:
- Find exploits in "human code" too subtle for any human to notice
- Generate code too complicated for humans to understand even with decades of explanation
- Problems humans stuck on for decades seem "just so obvious" to superintelligence
- "Like high-schoolers stuck on Newtonian physics while it's off exploring quantum mechanics"

**Minecraft speedrun analogy**: Watch video of beating Minecraft in 20 seconds—most players have "almost no clue what's going on." Imagine this applied to all science, technology, economy.

## Power and Capabilities

### R&D Acceleration

**Billions of superintelligent scientists** (much smarter than smartest humans):
- Work day and night on R&D across all fields
- Compress R&D effort humans would do in next century into years
- 20th century technological progress (flight → moon landing → ICBMs) in matter of years
- Move at 10x+ human speed once robotics solved

### Solving Robotics

Primarily ML algorithms problem (not hardware):
- Superintelligence will likely figure out ML for robots
- Few years delay possible (ML research, physical testing, initial production ramp-up)
- But not fundamental barrier

### AI Capabilities Explosion

Initial AGIs may have limitations preventing full automation in some domains:
- Automated AI research will quickly solve these
- Enable automation of any and all cognitive work

### Economic/Industrial Explosion

**Growth regime shift**: From ~2% annual growth to potentially:
- 30%+/year growth rates
- Perhaps multiple doublings per year
- Fundamental shift comparable to industrial revolution

**Mechanism**:
- Automated labor removes historical constraint on capital accumulation
- Self-replicating robot factories can expand without limit
- "Factorio-world": factories building more factories exponentially

**Frictions**: Societal resistance, regulation (e.g., lawyers/doctors must be human), desire to retain human nannies. But in domains without barriers, industrial explosion.

### Military Transformation

See [[military-advantage-from-superintelligence]] for details.

**Near-term** (even cognitive-only superintelligence):
- Superhuman hacking schemes disabling adversary militaries
- Drone swarms
- Threatening instant death for opposing leadership
- Advanced bioweapons targeting specific groups

**Medium-term** (with robotics):
- Roboarmies
- Completely new weapons paradigms
- Novel WMDs with thousandfold increases in destructive power
- Invulnerable laser-based missile defense
- Things "we can't yet fathom"

**Result**: 21st century military vs. 19th century horses and bayonets-level advantage

### Coup/Overthrow Capability

Whoever controls superintelligence could potentially overthrow US government:

**Mechanisms without robots**:
- Hack any undefended military/election/TV system
- Cunningly persuade generals and electorates
- Economically outcompete nation-states
- Design novel synthetic bioweapons
- Pay humans in bitcoin to synthesize bioweapons

**Historical parallel**: Cortes (500 Spaniards) conquered Aztec empire of millions. Pizarro (300) conquered Inca empire. Alfonso (1000 Portuguese) conquered Indian Ocean. Not godlike power but "technological edge and advantage in strategic and diplomatic cunning led to utterly decisive advantage."

## Timeline to Superintelligence

**From AGI (2027) to Superintelligence**:

If rapid intelligence explosion:
- **2027**: AGI achieved
- **2027-2028**: Automated AI research compresses decade into year (5+ OOMs algorithmic gains)
- **2028-2030**: Vastly superhuman systems

**Speed comparison**: ~3x the pace of child development. "Your 3x-speed-child just graduated high school; it'll be taking your job before you know it!"

## The Volatile Transition Period

### Intelligence Explosion Phase

**During** (2027-2028):
- Furiously racing through OOMs
- Weekly capability advances
- Little human-time for decisions
- Fog of war with ambiguous data
- International arms race backdrop
- Potential for things going "off the rails"

### Immediate Post-Superintelligence

**After achieving superintelligence** (2028-2030):
- Rapid development of novel military technology
- Repeatedly destabilized deterrence from new weapons/defenses
- Economic explosion beginning
- Integration of superintelligence into military and economy
- If secrets not locked down: multiple nation-states and rogue actors with their own super-WMDs
- Risk of self-destruction from new WMDs
- "Geopolitical fever-pitches and man-made perils of 20th century compressed into years"

### 2030s Outlook

"By the end of it, superintelligent AI systems will be running our military and economy. During all of this insanity, we'd have extremely scarce time to make the right decisions."

**Challenges**:
- Everything happening incredibly fast
- World going "insane"
- Extremely volatile, tense, dangerous period
- "One of the most intense and volatile moments of human history"

**But**: By end of 2030s, if we make it through: "world will have been utterly, unrecognizably transformed. A new world order will have been forged."

## Risks and Challenges

### Alignment Risks

See [[superalignment]].

**Core problem**: Handing off trust to systems whose understanding and abilities exceed humanity combined. Real possibility of losing control.

**Danger window**: Rapid transition from recognizable human-level systems (current alignment techniques work) to alien vastly-superhuman systems (fundamentally novel alignment problem).

### Proliferation Risks

Without adequate [[ai-security]]:
- Rogue states (North Korea, Iran, Russia)
- Terrorist groups
- Each developing own arsenal of super-WMDs
- Unpredictable, reckless actors with world-threatening capabilities

### Self-Destruction Risks

Historical trend: technology increases "destruction/$" ratio.

**Expected continuation**:
- Novel bioweapons (spread silently, kill with perfect lethality on command, cheaply accessible)
- Massively expanded nuclear arsenals with undetectable delivery
- Mosquito-sized poison-carrying drones targeting entire populations
- Other appalling possibilities from century's worth of progress

**Historical precedent**: Barely evaded self-destruction during Cold War. This time means could proliferate to rogue actors.

### Authoritarian Lock-in

If authoritarian state gets superintelligence first:

**Internal control**:
- Millions of AI-controlled robotic law enforcement
- Hypercharged surveillance
- Perfect lie detection
- Perfectly obedient robotic military (no coup risk)
- Eliminate all historical threats to dictator's rule

**Result**: Lock in authoritarian power for centuries/millennia. "Past dictatorships were never permanent"—superintelligence could change that.

## Stabilization Requirements

Post-superintelligence world requires:

1. **Nonproliferation regime**: Prevent rogue states/terrorists from accessing superintelligence
2. **Security hardening**: Critical infrastructure defended against superhuman hacking
3. **Offense/defense balance**: Stabilize via defensive applications (biodefense, etc.)
4. **Rogue AI control**: Tools to shut down uncareful projects
5. **Robot/AI speed adaptation**: Systems moving at 10-100x+ human speed—must be ready for rapid developments

Only realistic path: American leadership using healthy lead to develop and enforce norms for rest of world (similar to nuclear nonproliferation regime).

## Wait But Why Illustration

"What does it feel like to stand here?"—visualization of being at moment before explosive takeoff.

We're at the inflection point. After this, "things will just start happening incredibly fast."
