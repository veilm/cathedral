Perfect! Now let me provide a final summary of what I've created:

## Wiki Consolidation Complete

I've successfully consolidated Leopold Aschenbrenner's "Situational Awareness: The Decade Ahead" essay series into a concept-driven wiki with 11 interconnected articles.

### Articles Created and Decomposition Strategy

Rather than creating one article per source essay, I decomposed the content by **major conceptual themes**:

**Core Technical Arguments:**
1. **agi-timeline.md** - Timeline projections and basis for 2027 AGI
2. **counting-the-ooms.md** - Framework for measuring AI progress
3. **intelligence-explosion.md** - Recursive improvement mechanism
4. **unhobbling.md** - Transforming chatbots into agents
5. **superintelligence.md** - Nature and power of vastly superhuman AI

**Infrastructure & Resources:**
6. **trillion-dollar-cluster.md** - Industrial mobilization for compute

**Security & Competition:**
7. **ai-security.md** - Protecting secrets and weights from theft
8. **china-agi-competition.md** - China's path to competitiveness

**Safety & Governance:**
9. **superalignment.md** - Controlling superhuman AI systems
10. **military-advantage-from-superintelligence.md** - Decisive strategic implications
11. **the-project.md** - Inevitable government involvement

**Entry Point:**
12. **Index.md** - Comprehensive overview with categorized links

### Editorial Decisions

**Information Density:** Preserved specific numbers, dates, estimates, and arguments (e.g., "~0.5 OOMs/year," "12-24 month window," "$100B cluster").

**Complete Coverage:** All major themes from source material appear somewhere—early technical arguments, infrastructure scaling, security challenges, alignment problems, geopolitical competition, and governance imperatives.

**Cross-linking:** Every article links to multiple related articles using [[wiki-link]] notation. No orphans, no broken links.

**Concept Decomposition:** Single source files fed multiple articles (e.g., security material in both ai-security.md and china-agi-competition.md). Single articles drew from multiple sources (e.g., superintelligence.md synthesizes from parts 2, 3a, 3d).

**Balance:** Index.md written last to accurately reflect what was actually created, providing scannable categorized access to full wiki.

The wiki should now serve as a useful reference for understanding Aschenbrenner's core arguments about AGI timelines, technical progress mechanisms, security/safety challenges, and geopolitical/governance implications.
