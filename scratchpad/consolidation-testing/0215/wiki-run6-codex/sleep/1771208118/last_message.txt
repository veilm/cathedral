Created a concept-based wiki in `/home/oboro/src/cathedral/scratchpad/consolidation-testing/0215/wiki/` from all source files in `/tmp/dir/1771183647/essay/`.

Articles created and rationale:

1. `situational-awareness-overview.md`  
   Unifies the full series thesis, timeline, and argument structure so readers can orient before diving into subtopics.

2. `counting-the-ooms.md`  
   Captures the forecasting framework (compute + algorithmic efficiency + unhobbling), including key numeric estimates and caveats.

3. `intelligence-explosion.md`  
   Explains the recursive automation argument (automating AI research), bottlenecks, and why AGI is not treated as a stable endpoint.

4. `trillion-dollar-clusters.md`  
   Consolidates industrial mobilization claims: capex trajectory, datacenter economics, power bottlenecks, and chip-supply scaling.

5. `agi-security-and-espionage.md`  
   Covers algorithm-vs-weight theft timelines, state-actor threat model, and required “supersecurity” posture.

6. `superalignment.md`  
   Distills the control problem for superhuman systems, proposed technical path, and defense-in-depth strategy.

7. `us-china-superintelligence-race.md`  
   Consolidates the geopolitical/military race logic, Chinese competitiveness pathways, and lead-length safety implications.

8. `the-project.md`  
   Captures the governance endgame claim: transition to a government-led national-security structure in late 2020s.

9. `agi-realism.md`  
   Encodes the series’ ideological synthesis (“AGI Realism”) linking national-security realism with safety discipline.

10. `Index.md`  
    Written last as the navigation entry point, with categorized links and reading order across all concept articles.

Validation:

- Ran `wiki-check /home/oboro/src/cathedral/scratchpad/consolidation-testing/0215/wiki`.
- Fixed all **errors** (including broken placeholder links in pre-existing `AGENTS.md`).
- Final check passes with **0 errors**; only warnings are about `AGENTS.md` being an instruction file, not a wiki article.
