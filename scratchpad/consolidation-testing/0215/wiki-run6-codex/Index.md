# Situational Awareness Wiki Index
This wiki consolidates Leopold Aschenbrenner’s June 2024 *Situational Awareness: The Decade Ahead* series into a concept graph for fast retrieval. It tracks the series’ central forecast: AGI and then superintelligence likely arrive this decade, with industrial, security, and geopolitical consequences on a wartime scale. Articles are organized from forecasting mechanics to operational bottlenecks and governance endgame.

## Forecasting Core
- [[situational-awareness-overview]] - High-level synthesis of the full thesis, framing assumptions, and how all chapters fit together.
- [[counting-the-ooms]] - The quantitative extrapolation method using compute, algorithmic efficiency, and unhobbling multipliers to argue AGI-by-2027 plausibility.
- [[intelligence-explosion]] - The recursive automation argument for AGI-to-superintelligence acceleration once AI can automate AI research itself.

## Industrial And Infrastructure Constraints
- [[trillion-dollar-clusters]] - Capital, chip, datacenter, and electricity scaling logic behind $100B-to-$1T frontier cluster projections.

## Risk And Control Stack
- [[agi-security-and-espionage]] - Threat model for algorithm/weight theft, why current lab security is inadequate, and what “supersecurity” would require.
- [[superalignment]] - Why RLHF-style control breaks at superhuman capability and the proposed staged path to scalable oversight.

## Geopolitics And State Capacity
- [[us-china-superintelligence-race]] - Military-balance argument, China competitiveness pathways, and why lead length affects catastrophic risk.
- [[the-project]] - Prediction that AGI governance converges toward a government-led national-security program in the late 2020s.
- [[agi-realism]] - The series’ integrative doctrine: simultaneous commitment to national-security realism and high-reliability safety discipline.
