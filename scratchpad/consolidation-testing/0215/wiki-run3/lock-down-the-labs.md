# Lock Down The Labs

AGI labs must transition from startup security to government-level protection to prevent China from stealing algorithmic secrets and model weights that would eliminate any US lead.

## The Security Gap

**Current state**: AI labs operate with "random startup security"—the cybersecurity equivalent of "level 0" when frameworks require "level 3-4" for state-actor protection.

**What's needed**: Transition to government project with NSA-level security, similar to protecting nuclear secrets. This means SCIFs, airgapped facilities, constant monitoring, extreme access controls, and ability to imprison those who leak.

## What Must Be Protected

**[[algorithmic-secrets-security]]**: The breakthroughs being developed in next 12-24 months to overcome [[data-wall]] and continue scaling. Worth 10x-100x compute advantage. Without them, China stuck. With them, China catches up immediately.

**[[model-weights-security]]**: On 2-3 year timeline, preventing theft of AGI weights themselves. A single stolen file could give China instant copy of superintelligence and enable their own [[intelligence-explosion]].

## The Adversary

China's intelligence apparatus represents the most sophisticated espionage threat in history:
- FBI Director: PRC hacking operation greater than every major nation combined
- AI becoming #1 priority as CCP wakes up to AGI's national security implications
- Demonstrated capabilities: zero-click iPhone hacks, airgapped system penetration, supply chain compromise
- When fully mobilized, will employ extraordinary means and pay any cost

See [[chinese-espionage]] for detailed threat assessment.

## Why Private Labs Can't Do This Alone

Even with unlimited budget and best private security experts, defending against MSS #1 priority effort requires government:

**Vetting authority**: Only government can conduct deep background checks and hold threat of imprisonment for leaks.

**Physical security**: Military-base-level fortifications, SCIFs, airgapped facilities require government infrastructure and expertise.

**Technical capabilities**: NSA has unique expertise on state-actor attacks and defensive measures.

**Enforcement**: Private companies can't impose truly invasive restrictions (working from secure facilities, reduced freedom to leave, constant monitoring).

**Expert assessment**: Even with complete private crash course, high-level security experts estimate China would likely still exfiltrate AGI weights if it's their #1 priority. Only way to get to single-digit probability: Government project.

## The Manhattan Project Precedent

In 1939-1941, Leo Szilard fought for nuclear secrecy against fierce resistance:
- Scientists unused to secrecy, ran counter to open science instincts
- Seemed excessive until clearly necessary
- But military potential too great to share with Nazis

**Critical moment**: Fermi's refusal to publish graphite results led Germans down wrong path (heavy water instead of graphite moderators), dooming their bomb effort. Had results been published, Nazi Germany might have gotten the bomb.

For AGI: Same pattern. Security seems excessive until clearly necessary. But by then might be too late.

## Practical Implementation

**Timing**: Must happen before key algorithmic breakthroughs, not after. Once secrets exist, clock starts ticking on exfiltration.

**Scope**: Not just frontier labs—entire supply chain including chip design, cluster operations, key contractors.

**Restrictions**:
- Work from SCIFs only
- Airgapped systems for most sensitive work
- Severe limitations on foreign travel
- Constant monitoring and access controls
- Vetting of all personnel with access

**Trade-offs**: Yes, this will slow research somewhat. Yes, it will make researchers' lives harder. But alternative is delivering AGI to CCP.

## The Political Challenge

Hardest part isn't technical—it's political will:
- Researchers will resist (loss of freedom, slower collaboration)
- Companies will resist (operational complexity, talent recruitment)
- Public will question necessity before threat is obvious
- Civil libertarians will raise legitimate concerns

But stakes are existential. We're talking about potentially giving permanent dictatorial control to CCP vs. preserving ability to navigate to good future.

## The Narrow Window

Current trajectory: China getting nightly downloads of American AI research (per Marc Andreessen's assessment).

When to act: Before key algorithmic secrets are developed, ideally before labs crack [[data-wall]].

Cost of delay: Every month increases probability that critical secrets have already been stolen.

## What "Locked Down" Means

Not merely "better security practices." Real lockdown means:
- Physical: Work conducted in secure facilities, potentially on military bases
- Digital: Airgapped systems, no connection to internet, extreme access control
- Personnel: Deep vetting, monitoring, restrictions on movement and communication
- Legal: Severe criminal penalties for leaks, similar to nuclear secrets

This is not hypothetical future necessity—it's urgent present requirement.
