# Energy Transition Wiki

This wiki tracks the economics and deployment trajectory of renewable energy and grid-scale storage. It focuses on cost curves, integration challenges, and the key thresholds that determine when renewables displace fossil fuels in different applications.

## Cost Trajectories
- [[solar-cost-trajectory]] — The 89% cost decline in solar PV since 2010, Swanson's Law, and regional price variation
- [[battery-cost-trajectory]] — Lithium-ion price declines, LFP vs NMC chemistry shift, and the $100/kWh parity threshold

## Grid Integration
- [[grid-integration-challenges]] — The duck curve problem, storage as a solution, and the long-duration gap
