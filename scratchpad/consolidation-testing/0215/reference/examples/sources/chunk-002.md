Lithium-ion battery pack prices fell to USD 139/kWh in 2023, down from
USD 1,110/kWh in 2010 — an 87% decline. Cell-only prices reached USD 98/kWh.
BNEF projects pack prices could fall below USD 100/kWh by 2025, the threshold
widely considered necessary for EVs to reach purchase-price parity with ICE
vehicles without subsidies.

LFP (lithium iron phosphate) chemistry has overtaken NMC for grid-scale
storage due to lower cost ($90-110/kWh at cell level), longer cycle life
(4,000-6,000 cycles vs 1,500-2,000), and absence of cobalt/nickel supply
chain risk. CATL's LFP cells now dominate Chinese grid storage deployments.

Grid-scale battery storage (4-hour duration) LCOS fell to approximately
USD 150/MWh in favorable markets in 2023. This makes batteries competitive
with gas peakers in regions with high gas prices or where peakers face
capacity factor below 15%.

The learning rate for batteries is approximately 18% cost reduction per
doubling of cumulative production. Global battery manufacturing capacity
is projected to reach 6.8 TWh/year by 2030, up from roughly 1.5 TWh in 2023.
