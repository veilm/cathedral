Integrating variable renewables beyond 30-40% of electricity generation
requires systemic flexibility: storage, demand response, grid interconnection,
and dispatchable backup. The "duck curve" phenomenon — midday solar
overgeneration followed by steep evening ramp — is already visible in
California (CAISO), South Australia, and parts of Germany.

California's evening ramp reached 17 GW in 2023, requiring fast-ramping gas
plants or imports. Grid-scale batteries have begun absorbing midday surplus:
CAISO deployed 7.5 GW of battery capacity by end of 2023, up from 0.5 GW in
2020. On several days in spring 2023, batteries discharged 5+ GW during the
evening peak, materially flattening the ramp.

Long-duration storage (8-100+ hours) remains a gap. Current lithium-ion
economics favor 2-4 hour durations. Technologies targeting longer durations
include iron-air (Form Energy, targeting $20/kWh), compressed air, gravity-
based systems, and green hydrogen. None have reached commercial scale for
grid applications as of 2023, though Form Energy broke ground on a pilot
manufacturing facility in West Virginia.

Cross-border interconnection is the other major integration tool. The EU
targets 15% interconnection ratio by 2030 (cross-border capacity as % of
installed generation). Current average is approximately 10%.
