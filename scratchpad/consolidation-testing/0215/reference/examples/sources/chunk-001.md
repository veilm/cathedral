The global weighted average levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) of newly
commissioned utility-scale solar PV fell by 89% between 2010 and 2022, from
USD 0.445/kWh to USD 0.049/kWh. In 2022, newly commissioned solar PV had an
LCOE that was 29% lower than the cheapest fossil fuel-fired option globally.

Onshore wind LCOE fell by 69% over the same period, from USD 0.107/kWh to
USD 0.033/kWh. Offshore wind costs fell by 59%, from USD 0.197/kWh to
USD 0.081/kWh, though they remain significantly higher than onshore.

Swanson's Law — the observation that solar module prices drop roughly 20% for
every doubling of cumulative shipped volume — has held remarkably well over
four decades. Cumulative installed solar capacity reached 1.2 TW in 2022,
up from 40 GW in 2010.

The cost declines are not uniform geographically. India and China achieve
utility-scale solar at USD 0.030-0.040/kWh, while European projects average
USD 0.060-0.080/kWh due to lower irradiance, higher labor costs, and
permitting delays.
