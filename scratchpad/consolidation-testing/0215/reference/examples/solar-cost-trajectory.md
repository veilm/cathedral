# Solar Cost Trajectory

Utility-scale solar PV has fallen 89% in LCOE since 2010, from $0.445/kWh to $0.049/kWh globally weighted average (IRENA 2022 data). It is now 29% cheaper than the cheapest fossil fuel option globally, making it the default choice for new generation capacity in most markets.

## The Learning Curve

Swanson's Law — roughly 20% cost reduction per doubling of cumulative shipped volume — has held for four decades. This is not a vague trend; it's a manufacturing learning curve driven by silicon processing improvements, economies of scale, and supply chain maturation. Cumulative installed capacity reached 1.2 TW in 2022, up from 40 GW in 2010 — a 30x increase that, at 20% per doubling, accounts for the bulk of the cost decline.

The implication for forecasting: if deployment continues doubling every 3-4 years, another 40-50% cost reduction by 2030 is consistent with the historical rate. At that point, solar LCOE would be in the $0.025-0.030/kWh range in favorable geographies — cheaper than the marginal fuel cost of existing gas plants, not just new-build.

## Geographic Variation

The global average masks wide dispersion. India and China achieve $0.030-0.040/kWh today, already near the 2030 forecast for less favorable regions. European projects average $0.060-0.080/kWh due to three compounding factors: lower solar irradiance (capacity factors of 10-15% vs 20-25% in sunbelt regions), higher labor and permitting costs, and longer development timelines.

This spread matters for investment: a solar project in Rajasthan generates roughly twice the energy per dollar of panel as one in northern Germany. The levelized cost gap will persist even as module costs converge, because irradiance is geography, not technology.

## What This Means for Displacement

Solar is already the cheapest source of new electricity in most of the world. The remaining question is not whether solar wins on cost but whether the grid can absorb it — see [[grid-integration-challenges]]. The duck curve and storage requirements become the binding constraints, not panel economics.

The [[battery-cost-trajectory]] is the complement: cheap solar needs cheap storage to deliver firm power. Together, solar + 4-hour batteries are approaching the cost of new gas combined-cycle plants in favorable markets.
