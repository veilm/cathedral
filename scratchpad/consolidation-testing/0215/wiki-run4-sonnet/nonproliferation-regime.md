# Nonproliferation Regime

A US-led nonproliferation regime for superintelligence, modeled on nuclear nonproliferation efforts, may be the only realistic path to stabilizing the post-superintelligence world and avoiding self-destruction.

## The Nuclear Precedent

**Atoms for Peace, IAEA, and NPT**:
- US offered to share peaceful benefits of nuclear technology
- In exchange for nonproliferation commitments and safety standards
- International Atomic Energy Agency provided oversight
- Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons established norms
- "That's the path we took with nukes...and it's the only path that's been shown to work"

**Underwritten by power**: Ultimately backed by American military dominance, not just goodwill or multilateral agreements.

## Why International Treaties Unlikely to Work

**Unstable equilibrium problem**:
- When both CCP and USG are AGI-pilled enough to take safety seriously...
- Also both realize international/military predominance at stake
- Being months behind could mean permanently left behind
- "Breakout" too easy: incentive to race ahead with intelligence explosion too great
- Fear that others will act on this incentive

**Comparison to stable vs. unstable arms control**:
- 1980s nuclear arms reduction: stable because both sides still had thousands of nukes, MAD assured
- Very low weapons counts or rapid technological change: unstable
- Zero nukes wouldn't be stable; someone could secretly build and gain overmatch
- Post-WWI arms limitations and Washington Naval Treaty: destabilized rather than stabilized

**Rapid capabilities growth makes stability hard**:
- "If mere months of lead on AGI would give an utterly decisive advantage, this makes stable disarmament on AI similarly difficult"
- Rogue upstart or treaty-breaker could gain huge edge with secret crash program
- Temptation too great for arrangements to be stable

**Track record**: "How have those climate treaties gone? That seems like a dramatically easier problem compared to this."

**Verdict**: "Arms control equilibrium, at least in the early phase around superintelligence, seems extremely unstable."

## The Path That Could Work

**Requires healthy US lead** (1-2 years, not 1-2 months):

When clear US will decisively win:
- Adversaries know they won't win
- Only option is coming to table
- US prefers avoiding feverish standoff or last-ditch sabotage attempts

**The offer to adversaries**:
- Guarantee noninterference in their affairs
- Share peaceful benefits of superintelligence
- In exchange: nonproliferation, safety norms, stability commitments

**Broader coalition** (beyond core adversaries):
- Extend benefits to wide group of countries (including non-democracies)
- Commit to not offensive use against them
- In exchange: refrain from own superintelligence projects
- Safety commitments on AI system deployment
- Restrictions on dual-use applications

**Goal**: Reduce incentives for arms races, bring broad coalition under US-led umbrella for post-superintelligence world order.

## Why Lead Is Necessary

**Margin for safety**:
- 1-2 year lead: room to "cash in" parts of lead to get safety right
- Can delay during intelligence explosion for alignment research
- Can dedicate extra months to solve critical safety challenges
- Space to stabilize after novel WMD inventions (focus on defensive applications first)
- Time for human decision-makers to make right decisions given rapid pace

**Versus tight race** (1-2 month lead):
- No margin at all for safety
- Must race no-holds-barred through intelligence explosion
- Barreling toward vastly superhuman systems in months without ability to slow down
- Extremely volatile with rapid military tech destabilizing deterrence
- If secrets/weights not locked down: multiple rogue states close too, each with super-WMDs
- "Even if we barely managed to inch out ahead, it would likely be a pyrrhic victory"
- "Existential struggle would have brought world to brink of total self-destruction"

## American Leadership Requirements

**Must win the race**:
- Lock down [[ai-lab-security|algorithmic secrets and weights]]
- Build [[training-clusters|clusters in US]], not dictatorships
- Bundle Western efforts (best scientists, all GPUs, trillions in buildouts)
- Protect datacenters from sabotage/attack

**Enforcement capability**:
- Subvert Russia, North Korea, Iran, terrorists from using superintelligence for WMDs
- Use superintelligence to harden critical infrastructure security
- Stabilize offense/defense balance in biology and other domains
- Develop tools to safely control superintelligence
- Shut down rogue superintelligences from uncareful projects
- Handle six-sigma upheavals from compressed technological progress

**Coalition building**:
- Tighter alliance (Quebec Agreement model): UK, Japan, South Korea, NATO, core democratic allies
- Secret pact: pool resources, won't use against each other without mutual consent
- Broader benefit-sharing (Atoms for Peace model): peaceful benefits for nonproliferation

## The Timing

**When to offer the deal**:
- Once clear US will decisively win
- Before situation becomes unstable/violent
- While adversaries recognize coming to table is their best option

**Initial period challenges**:
- Most extraordinary national security exigency
- Using superintelligence to stabilize whatever volatile situation emerges
- Developing countermeasures to new threats
- Getting safety right before wider deployment

**Later**:
- Once stabilized, civilian applications can flourish privately
- Safety norms and nonproliferation maintained
- But unlike nuclear where full plans were secret, here the systems themselves will eventually need to be shared for peaceful uses

## Historical Warning

"Humanity barely evaded self-destruction during the Cold War."

New threats could be thousandfold more potent:
- Novel bioweapons (silent spread, perfect lethality on command)
- Vastly expanded nuclear arsenals with undetectable delivery
- Mosquito-sized poison drones targeting entire populations
- "Hard to know what a century's worth of technological progress would yield—but I am confident it would unfold appalling possibilities"

**This time**: Proliferation risk even worse if weights not protected
- North Korea already has concerted bioweapons program
- Primary constraint: limits of their small circle of scientists
- Superintelligence removes that constraint
- "With what unholy new concoctions will they hold us hostage?"

## Bottom Line

"A healthy lead by an American-led coalition of democracies—and a solemn exercise of this leadership to stabilize whatever volatile situation we find ourselves in—is probably the safest path to navigating past this precipice."

"But in the heat of the AGI race, we better not screw it up."
