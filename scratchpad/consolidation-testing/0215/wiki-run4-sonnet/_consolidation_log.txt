Perfect! Now let me provide a final summary of what I created:

## Wiki Consolidation Complete

I've successfully consolidated Leopold Aschenbrenner's "Situational Awareness: The Decade Ahead" essay series into a comprehensive wiki with 19 articles.

### Articles Created and Decomposition Strategy

Rather than creating one article per source chapter, I decomposed the content by **concept**, resulting in:

**Core Technical Concepts (7 articles)**:
- `agi-timeline.md` - Timeline predictions and evidence
- `counting-the-ooms.md` - Methodology for capability forecasting
- `intelligence-explosion.md` - Rapid AGI→superintelligence transition
- `gpt-models.md` - Historical capability progression
- `algorithmic-efficiency.md` - Compute multipliers and trends
- `unhobbling.md` - Latent capability unlocking
- `data-wall.md` - Training data exhaustion challenge

**Infrastructure & Economics (3 articles)**:
- `training-clusters.md` - Compute cluster scaling projections
- `ai-investment.md` - Capital mobilization trends
- `algorithmic-secrets.md` - Most valuable IP assets

**National Security (5 articles)**:
- `ai-lab-security.md` - Current catastrophic security failures
- `china-competition.md` - How China can compete
- `decisive-military-advantage.md` - Why superintelligence dominates
- `the-project.md` - Inevitable government AGI program
- `nonproliferation-regime.md` - Path to stabilization

**Cross-Cutting Themes (3 articles)**:
- `automated-ai-research.md` - Core mechanism of intelligence explosion
- `superintelligence.md` - Nature and power of vastly superhuman systems
- `superalignment-problem.md` - Challenge of controlling superintelligence

**Meta (2 articles)**:
- `situational-awareness.md` - What it means and who has it
- `leopold-aschenbrenner.md` - Author background and perspective

### Editorial Decisions

**What I emphasized**:
- Specific numbers, dates, and quantitative estimates (e.g., "100 million human-researcher-equivalents," "$100B clusters," "0.5 OOMs/year")
- Concrete examples and analogies (Gulf War, AlphaGo move 37, speedrun visualization)
- Multi-source synthesis (e.g., `intelligence-explosion.md` draws from essays 1, 2, and others)
- Cross-linking related concepts to create dense knowledge graph

**What I de-emphasized**:
- Redundant restatements of same points across chapters
- Extensive footnotes (preserved key ones but integrated others into main text)
- HTML markup and website navigation structure
- Some extended analogies and asides

**Information density approach**:
- Preserved specific numbers and estimates throughout
- Maintained key quotes that capture tone and stakes
- Kept technical details (compute calculations, power requirements, security threat examples)
- Included concrete timelines and milestones

Every article is linked from Index.md and interconnected through wiki-links, creating a navigable knowledge graph with no orphan articles or broken links.
