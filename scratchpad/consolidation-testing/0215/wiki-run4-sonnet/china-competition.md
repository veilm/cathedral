# China Competition

China has a clear path to being competitive in the AGI race through outbuilding the US on compute and stealing algorithms, despite current Western leads.

## Current Status (2024)

**Behind but not out**:
- Leading Chinese LLMs (Yi-Large) ~1 year behind GPT-4
- Often mere ripoffs of American open source (Yi-34B ≈ Llama2 with few lines changed)
- Chinese deep learning less important than past (Baidu published early scaling laws)
- Publishes more papers than US but hasn't driven recent key breakthroughs

**Why many are complacent**:
- Chip export controls seem effective
- Leading AI labs in US/UK
- Chinese models "fine" but second-tier

"That's all merely a prelude, however. If and when the CCP wakes up to AGI, we should expect extraordinary efforts."

## Two Paths to Competitiveness

### 1. Compute: Outbuild the US

**Chips**:
- China demonstrated ability to manufacture 7nm chips (SMIC)
- 7nm sufficient! (Nvidia A100s used 7nm)
- Indigenous Huawei Ascend 910B on SMIC 7nm only ~2-3x worse on performance/$ than Nvidia equivalent
- Yield/maturity debated, but reasonable chance of large-scale production in few years

**Economics of chip disadvantage manageable**:
- Even 3x more expensive chips much less than 3x increase in overall datacenter costs
- Logic fab <5% of Nvidia GPU cost, GPUs ~50-60% of datacenter cost
- Even 10x more expensive chips: China could stomach without hugely increasing costs

**Power: China's advantage**:
- Last decade China built new electricity capacity ≈ entire US capacity
- US capacity remained basically flat
- 100GW cluster requires ~20% of current US electricity
- For China: much more doable given building track record
- US: stuck in environmental review, permitting, regulation for decade

"If there's one thing China can do better than the US it's building stuff."

Conclusion: "Quite plausible that China will be able to simply outbuild the US on the largest training clusters."

### 2. Algorithms: Steal the Secrets

Western labs well ahead on [[algorithmic-efficiency]], worth 10x-100x compute advantage. But current [[ai-lab-security]] "essentially makes it trivial for China to infiltrate American labs."

**Unless security improves**: "I expect China to be able to simply steal the key algorithmic ingredients for AGI, and match US capabilities."

**Even worse**: Without better security, China won't even need to train own AGI - just steal the AGI weights directly. Once they have copy of automated AI researcher, can launch own [[intelligence-explosion]]. If willing to apply less caution than US, could "race through the intelligence explosion more quickly, outrunning us to superintelligence."

## When CCP Wakes Up

Current situation like "counting out Google in the AI race when ChatGPT came out in late 2022." Google hadn't yet focused efforts, looked far behind - but once woke up, year and half later "putting up a very serious fight."

**Triggers for CCP awakening**:
- Dramatic annual capability leaps
- AI revenue explosions, $10T valuations
- $100B+ cluster buildouts
- Trillion-dollar investments
- Early automation of cognitive jobs
- Consensus forming on AGI feasibility

"As every year we get dramatic leaps in AI capability...the CCP will take note. Much as I expect these leaps to wake up the USG to AGI, I would expect it to wake up the CCP to AGI—and to wake up to what being behind on AGI would mean for their national power."

## The Authoritarian Peril

**Dictatorial power**:
- Millions of AI-controlled robotic law enforcement
- Hypercharged mass surveillance
- Individual assessment of every citizen for dissent
- Near-perfect lie detection rooting out disloyalty
- Wholly controlled robotic military (no coup risk)
- "Whereas past dictatorships were never permanent, superintelligence could eliminate basically all historical threats to a dictator's rule and lock in their power"

**The regime**:
- Founded on "continued worship" of greatest totalitarian mass-murderer (Mao: 40-80M victims)
- Recently put million Uyghurs in concentration camps
- Crushed free Hong Kong
- Systematic mass surveillance (tech + old-fashioned neighbor reporting)
- All text messages pass through censor
- Xi Jinping dictator-for-life
- Explicitly seeks China-centric world order
- Touts aims to militarily crush and "reeducate" Taiwan

"If America and her allies fail to win this race, we risk it all."

## Why Maintaining Lead Matters

**For safety**:
- Healthy lead (1-2 years) gives margin to get safety right
- Neck-and-neck race (1-2 months) means no safety margin
- Must race through intelligence explosion
- Rapid military tech development destabilizing deterrence
- Other rogue states (Russia, Iran, North Korea) also close

**For nonproliferation**:
- Need US leadership to enforce safety norms
- Only path: democratic alliance with healthy lead offering deal to adversaries
- When clear US will win decisively, adversaries come to table
- Exchange: noninterference guarantee + peaceful benefits for nonproliferation agreement

"The main—perhaps the only—hope we have is that an alliance of democracies has a healthy lead over adversarial powers. The United States must lead, and use that lead to enforce safety norms on the rest of the world."

## National Security Imperative

**What US must do**:
- Rapidly [[ai-lab-security]] lockdown (next 12-24 months critical)
- Build clusters in US not dictatorships
- AI labs must work with intelligence community and military
- "America's lead on AGI won't secure peace and freedom by just building the best AI girlfriend apps"

**Eerie convergence**: AGI timelines (~2027) converging with Taiwan invasion timelines (China ready by 2027 per US assessment). "Imagine if in 1960, the vast majority of the world's uranium deposits were somehow concentrated in Berlin!"

"There is a real chance that the AGI endgame plays out with the backdrop of world war. Then all bets are off."
