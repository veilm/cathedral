# Situational Awareness

Situational awareness in the AI context refers to understanding what is actually being built and its implications—currently possessed by perhaps only a few hundred people globally, mostly in San Francisco and at AI labs.

## The Gap

**Mainstream perception**:
- Nvidia analysts think 2024 might be near peak
- Pundits stuck on "it's just predicting the next word"
- See only hype and business-as-usual
- At most entertain another internet-scale technological change

**Reality being built**:
- AGI by 2025/26 (outpacing many college graduates)
- Superintelligence by end of decade
- Systems "smarter than you or I"
- National security forces "not seen in half a century"
- All-out race with CCP, possibly all-out war

"Everyone is now talking about AI, but few have the faintest glimmer of what is about to hit them."

## Who Has It

"There are perhaps a few hundred people, most of them in San Francisco and the AI labs, that have situational awareness."

**Their track record**:
- "A few years ago, these people were derided as crazy"
- "But they trusted the trendlines"
- "Which allowed them to correctly predict the AI advances of the past few years"
- "These are very smart people—the smartest people I have ever met"
- "They are the ones building this technology"

**Their future**: "Perhaps they will be an odd footnote in history, or perhaps they will go down in history like Szilard and Oppenheimer and Teller."

## What It Means

Seeing situational awareness as *visceral* not abstract:

**Tangible understanding**:
- "I can see it. I can see how AGI will be built"
- "I can basically tell you the cluster AGI will be trained on and when it will be built"
- "The rough combination of algorithms we'll use"
- "The unsolved problems and the path to solving them"
- "The list of people that will matter"

**Emotional weight**:
- "Sure, going all-in leveraged long Nvidia in early 2023 has been great and all, but the burdens of history are heavy. I would not choose this."

## The Responsibility

"The scariest realization is that there is no crack team coming to handle this."

**Reality vs childhood expectations**:
- No "heroic scientists, uber-competent military men, calm leaders on it"
- "The world is incredibly small"
- "When facade comes off, it's usually just a few folks behind the scenes who are the live players"
- "Desperately trying to keep things from falling apart"

**Current state**:
- "Perhaps a few hundred people in world who realize what's about to hit us"
- Author either personally knows or is one degree from "everyone who could plausibly run [[the-project|The Project]]"
- "The few folks behind the scenes who are desperately trying to keep things from falling apart are you and your buddies and their buddies. That's it. That's all there is."

## Historical Parallel: San Francisco as Bellwether

"You can see the future first in San Francisco."

**Observable trend**:
- Talk shifted from $10B clusters → $100B clusters → trillion-dollar clusters
- "Every six months another zero is added to the boardroom plans"
- Behind scenes: "fierce scramble to secure every power contract still available for rest of decade"
- "American big business gearing up to pour trillions into long-unseen mobilization"

**What's coming**: "By end of decade, American electricity production will have grown tens of percent; from shale fields of Pennsylvania to solar farms of Nevada, hundreds of millions of GPUs will hum."

## The Stakes

"Someday it will be out of our hands. But right now, at least for the next few years of midgame, the fate of the world rests on these people."

**Questions**:
- Will the free world prevail?
- Will we tame superintelligence, or will it tame us?
- Will humanity skirt self-destruction once more?

"The stakes are no less."

**Final assessment**: "These are great and honorable people. But they are just people. Soon, the AIs will be running the world, but we're in for one last rodeo. May their final stewardship bring honor to mankind."

## AGI Realism

Author's proposed "third way" between doomers and e/accs:

**Core tenets**:
1. **Superintelligence is a matter of national security**: Most powerful weapon mankind has ever built, not fun Silicon Valley project
2. **America must lead**: Can't pause; must rapidly scale. But also can't have amateur security or dictator control. Labs must put national interest first.
3. **Don't screw it up**: Real safety risks. Manageable but require serious effort. "Improvising won't cut it."

"As the acceleration intensifies, I only expect the discourse to get more shrill. But my greatest hope is that there will be those who feel the weight of what is coming, and take it as a solemn call to duty."
