# AGI Timeline

AGI (artificial general intelligence) by 2027 is strikingly plausible according to current trendline extrapolations. This represents a ~4-year jump from GPT-4 (2023) comparable to the GPT-2-to-GPT-4 leap.

## Historical Progress

From 2019 to 2023, AI systems progressed from GPT-2 (preschooler-level: barely stringing together coherent sentences) to GPT-4 (smart high-schooler: acing college exams, writing sophisticated code, reasoning through difficult problems). This represents approximately 4-6 orders of magnitude (OOMs) of effective compute scaleup.

GPT-3 (2020) marked an intermediate stage, reaching elementary school level capabilities with basic few-shot learning and simple commercial applications.

## 2027 Projection

Counting forward from GPT-4, we should expect another GPT-2-to-GPT-4-sized jump by end of 2027, driven by:

- **Physical compute**: ~2-3 OOMs increase (from ~$500M GPT-4 cluster to $10s-100s of billions clusters)
- **[[algorithmic-efficiency]]**: ~2 OOMs from continued 0.5 OOMs/year trend
- **[[unhobbling]]**: Substantial gains from chatbot to agent transformation

This would yield systems capable of automating AI research itself—the threshold for [[intelligence-explosion]].

## Uncertainty and Caveats

The primary risk to this timeline is the [[data-wall]]—running out of internet training data. However, industry leaders express confidence that algorithmic solutions (synthetic data, RL, self-play) will overcome this constraint.

Alternative timelines could be earlier (if algorithmic breakthroughs accelerate) or later (if data wall proves intractable). The author notes this is the "modal AGI year" given how rapidly we're racing through OOMs this decade versus the slower pace expected thereafter.
