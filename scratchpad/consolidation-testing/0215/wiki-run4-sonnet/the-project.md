# The Project

By 2026-2028, the US government will launch a Manhattan Project-style effort for AGI, transitioning superintelligence development from private startups to a national security project.

## Why It's Inevitable

"I find it an insane proposition that the US government will let a random SF startup develop superintelligence. Imagine if we had developed atomic bombs by letting Uber just improvise."

**Descriptive claim** (not primarily normative): Once clear we're on cusp of AGI and superintelligence, USG will be at helm "in one form or another." Historical pattern: appears US asleep at wheel, then shifts into gear in extraordinary fashion.

**Technology category**: Will become clear AGI falls in category more like nukes than internet
- Yes dual-use (as was nuclear tech)
- But in AGI endgame fog, national security will be primary backdrop
- Civilian applications will have their time later

## The Path There

**2024-2025**: Each year brings dizzying acceleration
- Every 6 months another zero added to cluster plans
- AI revenue growing rapidly

**2025-2026**: Next truly shocking step-changes
- AI driving $100B+ annual revenues for big tech
- Outcompeting PhDs in problem-solving
- $10T companies and AI mania everywhere
- Models trained on multi-billion dollar clusters

**2026-2027**: Key threshold
- $100B revenue run rate milestone for big tech companies
- Full-fledged AI agents automating cognitive jobs
- First genuinely terrifying AI demonstrations (bioweapons, hacking, etc.)
- CCP infiltration of labs potentially discovered
- Consensus forms: "we are on the cusp of AGI...on the cusp of superintelligence"

**Late 2026/2027/2028**: The mood shifts
- "Somewhere around 26/27 or so, the mood in Washington will become somber"
- "Before long, The Project will be on"
- Question in every backroom briefing: "do we need an AGI Manhattan Project?"
- Clear: "most important challenge for national security since atomic bomb"

## Why Government Involvement Necessary

### 1. National Defense Project

Superintelligence = United States' most important national defense project. By early 2030s, entire US arsenal will be obsolete. Need to:
- Completely reshape forces within years
- Deploy superintelligence defensively first (survive new threats)
- Integrate into military systems (failure = complete adversary dominance)
- Develop countermeasures to extreme threats

### 2. Sane Chain of Command

Can't have random CEOs with unilateral command of what's comparable to WMD:
- Random CEO having power to coup US government "quite plausible"
- "Imagine if Elon Musk had final command of nuclear arsenal"
- Random nonprofit boards shouldn't control nuclear arsenal either
- AI labs' "utter lack of internal controls" means random employees could go rogue

"As a society, we've decided democratic governments should control the military; superintelligence will be, at least at first, the most powerful military weapon."

Burkean argument: institutions, constitutions, checks and balances that constrain government power have "withstood test of hundreds of years." Special AI lab governance "collapsed the first time tested."

### 3. [[ai-lab-security|Security]]

Current private company security catastrophically insufficient:
- Basically handing AGI to CCP
- Won't even get "North Korea-proof" on current course
- Impossible for private company to defend against full MSS effort

Requires government infrastructure:
- Authority to intensely vet employees
- Threaten imprisonment for leaking
- Physical security for datacenters
- NSA/intelligence community expertise and know-how
- "If we're going to be at all serious about this, we obviously need to lock this stuff down"

### 4. Safety

Private labs are startups with commercial incentives:
- Competition could push racing through intelligence explosion
- Haven't demonstrated competence/trustworthiness/seriousness
- Some actors will throw safety by the wayside
- Weights will already be stolen anyway (CCP/North Korea safety precautions)

Need coordination and hard tradeoffs:
- "Spending some of our lead" to solve safety challenges
- Making difficult calls during "fog of war" of intelligence explosion
- Example decision: "Alignment metrics ambiguous, warning signs, should we delay 3 months but China stole weights and racing ahead..."
- "More like fighting a war" than careful regulatory evaluation

### 5. International Stabilization

Will need government to:
- Win race against authoritarian powers
- Prevent instant theft of weights
- Bundle Western efforts (scientists, GPUs, trillions in buildouts)
- Protect datacenters from sabotage/attack
- Develop and enforce [[nonproliferation-regime]]
- Subvert rogue states from using superintelligence for WMDs
- Harden security against extreme hacking capabilities
- Stabilize offense/defense balance
- Control rogue superintelligences from others' projects
- Handle six-sigma upheavals from century of tech progress in years

## Operational Structure

**Not literal nationalization**: More sophisticated orchestration
- Relationship similar to DoD with Boeing/Lockheed Martin
- Joint venture between cloud providers, AI labs, government
- "Voluntarily" agreed merger (like 2023 White House commitments)
- Congressional involvement for trillions of investment and checks-and-balances
- Defense contracting or similar mechanisms

**The core**:
- Few hundred researchers move to secure location
- Trillion-dollar cluster built in record speed
- Work from SCIFs
- Extreme vetting and monitoring
- By 2027/2028 underway, 2028/2029 intelligence explosion begins

## International Coalition

**Tighter alliance** (Quebec Agreement model):
- United Kingdom (Deepmind)
- Japan and South Korea (chip supply chain)
- NATO and core democratic allies (industrial base)
- Secret pact: pool resources, coordinate on safety/security
- Won't use against each other without mutual consent

**Broader benefit-sharing** (Atoms for Peace / NPT model):
- Offer peaceful benefits to wider countries
- Commit to not offensive use against them
- In exchange: refrain from own superintelligence projects, safety commitments, dual-use restrictions
- Reduces arms race incentives
- US-led umbrella for post-superintelligence world order

## Critical Variables

**When not if**: Does government realize what's happening 2 years before intelligence explosion, or in middle of it? "Earlier seems better."

**Competence**: How will it be organized? What does sane chain of command look like?
- "Scarcely any attention has gone into figuring this out"
- "Almost all other AI lab and AI governance politicking is a sideshow. This is the ballgame."

## The Endgame

**The task**:
- Build AGI fast
- Put economy on wartime footing for hundreds of millions of GPUs
- Lock it down, weed out spies, fend off CCP attacks
- Manage 100 million AGIs automating research
- Keep things together through rapid intelligence explosion
- Prevent rogue superintelligence from seizing control
- Use superintelligences to develop stabilizing technologies
- Rapidly remake US forces
- Navigate tensest international situation ever

"They better be good, I'll say that."

**For those called**:
- "Most important thing we ever did"
- "Stressful" but duty to serve free world
- Like "peculiar AI-researcher-college-town" but stakes all too real

"See you in the desert, friends."

## Civilian Applications After

Like nuclear technology, civilian uses will flourish after initial period:
- Nuclear: weapons reserved for government, but civilian nuclear energy private (until environmentalists shut down)
- Boeing: B-29/B-47/B-52 for military → Boeing 707 commercial jet
- Also: radar, satellites, rockets, gene technology
- Military uses of superintelligence remain government-reserved
- Private companies pursue civilian applications once stabilized

"Even in worlds with The Project, a private, pluralistic, market-based, flourishing ecosystem of civilian applications of superintelligence will have its day."
