# Superintelligence

Superintelligence refers to AI systems vastly smarter than humans—qualitatively, not just quantitatively—that would emerge by the end of the decade following an [[intelligence-explosion]].

## Power and Capabilities

**Quantitatively superhuman**:
- Billions of agents running on 100s of millions of GPUs
- Thinking orders of magnitude faster than humans
- Quickly master any domain
- Write trillions of lines of code
- Read every research paper in every field before you finish one abstract
- Gain billions of human-equivalent years of experience in weeks
- Work 100% of time with peak energy and focus

**Qualitatively superhuman**:
- Novel, creative, complicated behavior beyond human understanding
- Like AlphaGo's famous move 37: "completely novel and creative behaviors beyond human understanding"
- Will find exploits in "human code" too subtle for any human to notice
- Generate code too complicated to understand even with decades of explanation
- Difficult problems that stump humans for decades will "seem just so obvious to them"
- "We'll be like high-schoolers stuck on Newtonian physics while it's off exploring quantum mechanics"

**Visualization**: Like video game speedruns (beating Minecraft in 20 seconds using exploits incomprehensible to normal players). "Imagine this applied to all domains of science, technology, and the economy."

## Broader Explosive Progress

Beyond narrow AI research automation, superintelligence applied to R&D across fields:

**AI capabilities explosion**: Solve remaining limitations preventing automation in all domains

**Robotics**: "Superintelligence won't stay purely cognitive for long"
- Primarily ML algorithms problem, not hardware
- Automated AI researchers will likely solve it
- Factories: human-run → AI-directed with human labor → fully run by robot swarms
- Possible few years delay for physical-world testing and initial production ramp

**Scientific/technological acceleration**:
- Billion superintelligent scientists, engineers, technologists
- Robot technicians moving at 10x+ human speed
- Compress R&D effort of next century into years
- "Imagine if the technological progress of the 20th century were compressed into less than a decade"
- Airplanes → man on moon and ICBMs in matter of years

**Economic/industrial explosion**:
- Automated labor + technological progress → 30%+/year growth (vs historical 2%)
- Multiple doublings per year possible
- Self-replicating robot factories rapidly covering Nevada desert
- Fundamental shift in growth regime (like agricultural → industrial revolution)
- Historical precedent: China spent >40% GDP on investment for two decades

**Military revolution**: [[decisive-military-advantage]] within years
- Superhuman hacking capabilities
- Roboarmies and autonomous drone swarms
- Completely new weapons paradigms
- New WMDs with thousandfold destructive power
- Impenetrable missile defense
- Repeatedly upending deterrence equilibria

## The Danger

**Power to overthrow governments**:
- "Whoever controls superintelligence will quite possibly have enough power to seize control from pre-superintelligence forces"
- Even without robots: hack military/election/TV systems, persuade generals/electorates, economically outcompete, design bioweapons and pay humans in bitcoin to synthesize

**Historical precedent**: 1500s conquests
- Cortés and ~500 Spaniards conquered Aztec empire (millions)
- Pizarro and ~300 Spaniards conquered Inca empire (millions)
- Alfonso and ~1000 Portuguese conquered Indian Ocean
- "Didn't have god-like power, but Old World's technological edge and strategic/diplomatic cunning led to utterly decisive advantage"

**Dictatorial lock-in**:
- Millions of AI-controlled robotic law enforcement
- Hypercharged mass surveillance
- Individual assessment of every citizen for dissent
- Perfect lie detection, wholly controlled robotic military
- "Whereas past dictatorships were never permanent, superintelligence could eliminate basically all historical threats to a dictator's rule and lock in their power"

## Timeline to Superintelligence

From AGI (likely 2027): "strikingly plausible that by 2027, models will be able to do the work of an AI researcher/engineer"

To superintelligence: "<1 year" via intelligence explosion, "at most just a few years, but perhaps even just a few months"

By end of 2020s decade: "We will have superintelligence, in the true sense of the word"

## The Critical Period

"The intelligence explosion and the immediate post-superintelligence period will be one of the most volatile, tense, dangerous, and wildest periods ever in human history."

Challenges:
- Ensuring we can [[superalignment-problem|control and trust]] these systems
- Surviving the [[wmd-risks|new means of mass destruction]]
- Navigating [[china-competition|international competition]]
- Preventing [[ai-lab-security|theft]] by adversaries
- Managing the [[decisive-military-advantage|radical military shifts]]

"We are in for a wild ride."
