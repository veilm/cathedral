# AI Lab Security and AGI Secrets
A major claim of the series is that frontier labs are operating far below required security levels for assets that are becoming national-defense critical.

## Two Assets to Defend
The threat model separates:
- Model weights: deployable capability artifacts (eventually AGI/superintelligence itself).
- Algorithmic secrets: recipe breakthroughs that may be worth 10x–100x compute advantage.

The essays argue algorithmic-secrets security matters immediately (next 12–24 months), because post-LLM breakthroughs could be leaked before AGI weights even exist.

## Adversary Model
The adversary is state-level espionage (especially PRC services), not ordinary startup threat models. The text cites extensive precedent for high-end cyber, supply-chain, HUMINT, and physical operations, then argues AI labs should assume escalating, priority-target pressure as AGI salience rises.

## Claimed Current Gap
Current posture is described as closer to “tech-company baseline” than national-security-grade containment. Risks highlighted include broad internal access, weak siloing, dependency/supply-chain exposure, insider risk, and insufficiently hardened inference deployments.

## Required “Supersecurity” Direction
Proposed direction includes:
- Airgapped/high-assurance environments.
- SCIF-like workflows and strict compartmentalization.
- Government-grade vetting and monitoring.
- Strong hardware/cryptographic defenses plus defense-in-depth.
- Continuous red-teaming/pen-testing at state-actor level.

This is explicitly linked to a likely shift toward [[the-project-government-led-agi-endgame]], because private actors alone may be unable to hold against top-tier intelligence pressure.

## Why This Is a Safety Issue Too
Security is not only geopolitical competition. If dangerous models can be stolen, all alignment controls become bypassable. So weight security is a first-layer control in [[superalignment-and-superdefense]], and lead preservation in [[us-china-agi-race-and-free-world-strategy]] depends on it.
