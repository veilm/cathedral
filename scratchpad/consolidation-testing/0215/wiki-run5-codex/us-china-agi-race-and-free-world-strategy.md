# US-China AGI Race and Free-World Strategy
The geopolitical thesis is that superintelligence leadership confers decisive military and economic leverage, so AGI competition is treated as a core national-security contest.

## Decisive Advantage Claim
The essays analogize to episodes where technology deltas made force ratios misleading (for example Gulf War-era asymmetric effectiveness), then argue superintelligence could compress decades of military-tech progress into years.

This includes potential offense/defense discontinuities in cyber, autonomy, missile defense, bio, and strategic deterrence stability.

## Why China Is Not “Out of the Game”
Despite US/UK frontier lead, the series argues China can stay competitive via:
- Large-scale industrial mobilization (especially power/infrastructure build speed).
- Adequate-enough domestic compute capability, even at efficiency penalties.
- Espionage-based acquisition of algorithmic breakthroughs or weights if Western security remains weak.

Thus, complacency about controls or lead durability is treated as a strategic error.

## Why Lead Length Matters for Safety
A central argument is that a narrow lead (months) forces unsafe racing through takeoff, while a healthier lead (years) creates room to pause, test, harden alignment, and negotiate stabilization arrangements.

This links strategic competition directly to [[superalignment-and-superdefense]], not as separate domains.

## Post-Lead Strategy
The preferred end-state is a US-led democratic coalition that both:
- Secures and governs frontier development.
- Offers broader peaceful-benefit sharing and enforces nonproliferation/safety constraints.

This resembles a hybrid of wartime alliance mobilization and postwar arms-control institution building, and motivates [[the-project-government-led-agi-endgame]].
