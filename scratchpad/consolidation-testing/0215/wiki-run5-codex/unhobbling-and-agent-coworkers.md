# Unhobbling and Agent Coworkers
“Unhobbling” refers to post-base-model methods that unlock latent capability into useful, agentic performance; it is treated as a major progress driver alongside scaling.

## What Counts as Unhobbling
The essays group several techniques here:
- RLHF/instruction tuning to make raw models steerable.
- Chain-of-thought and reasoning scaffolds.
- Tool use (code execution, browsing, workflows).
- Longer context windows and richer retrieval.
- Agent loops (plan, execute, critique, revise).

Empirical examples in the series include large benchmark gains from scaffolding and posttraining relative to base use of the same underlying model.

## The “Chatbot to Coworker” Transition
The concrete forecast is that capability jumps may look discontinuous in deployment value:
- Intermediate systems require workflow redesign (“schlep”).
- A drop-in remote-worker agent (onboarded into company docs/tools/comms) is easier to substitute directly into existing labor structures.

Three proposed unlocks are repeatedly emphasized:
1. Onboarding/context integration into real organizational memory.
2. Test-time compute overhang (moving from minute-scale to day/week-scale reasoning loops).
3. Full computer-use autonomy rather than isolated API tools.

## Why This Matters for Timelines
Under this view, AGI is not “better chat.” It is a system that can independently execute long-horizon cognitive projects and automate AI research-relevant work. That directly supports [[agi-by-2027-scenario]] and sets the stage for [[intelligence-explosion-mechanism]].

It also changes labor/economic impact timing: large portions of remote cognitive work could shift quickly once agency and reliability cross thresholds.

## Risk Coupling
Unhobbling also increases risk surface: more autonomy, tool access, and long-horizon planning raise misuse and control stakes, tying directly into [[superalignment-and-superdefense]] and [[ai-lab-security-and-agi-secrets]].
