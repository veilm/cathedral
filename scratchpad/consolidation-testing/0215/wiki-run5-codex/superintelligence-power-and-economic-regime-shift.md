# Superintelligence Power and Economic Regime Shift
The essays treat superintelligence as a civilizational power transition, not a marginal productivity tool.

## Capability and Scale
Expected features include:
- Billions of AI agents running on very large compute fleets.
- Fast serial cognition plus large parallel replication.
- Cross-domain scientific and engineering acceleration.
- Ability to coordinate industrial systems at machine timescales.

The argument distinguishes quantitative superhumanity (more/faster workers) from qualitative superhumanity (novel strategies/abstractions inaccessible to humans).

## Economic Growth Claim
The series suggests potential shift from ordinary modern growth (~2%/yr) to much higher rates, potentially 10s of percent annually in unconstrained domains, if labor and R&D bottlenecks are removed through AI+robotics.

This is framed as another historical “growth mode” transition, analogous in form (not necessarily smoothness) to prior shifts from hunting to farming to industrial regimes.

## Military Consequence
Because economic capacity, R&D velocity, and autonomous force structure co-evolve, superintelligence is treated as a decisive military technology. This underpins the urgency of lead preservation in [[us-china-agi-race-and-free-world-strategy]].

## Instability and Peril
The same drivers amplify existential risk:
- Novel WMD design/proliferation.
- Strategic instability during rapid capability differentials.
- Compressed decision cycles for human institutions.

Hence the paired emphasis on [[superalignment-and-superdefense]] and strict [[ai-lab-security-and-agi-secrets]].
